<p>I heard about GraphViz ( <a href="http://www.graphviz.org" target="_blank"> http://www.graphviz.org </a>
) via an interview with the author of InstaViz ( <a href="http://instaviz.com" target="_blank"> http://instaviz.com
</a> ) and spent a little time this morning learning about
how GraphViz works and how to use it.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, check it out (and if you have a Mac, check out the
award-winning OSX version at <a href="http://www.pixelglow.com" target="_blank"> http://www.pixelglow.com
</a> ). When you’re freed from the need to think about
layout, alot of potential applications for charts like this open up, and in my
case this tool could play a significant role in a Google Wave (http://
wave.google.com) project I have been noodling on.</p>
