<p>My best memories of Valcom are when I worked in the fishbowl.</p>
<p>The fishbowl was a corner office in the 3113 building (at the time the
education center). It was a place for the I2 team to get away from the
disruption of the main office on Pinehurst.</p>
<p>I started working with the team somewhat covertly while I was a “regular tech”
at on the Rayovac contract. After sucessfully deploying MRTG on WindowsNT,
something happened and I was magically transported from the bowels of “the
third ranked battery” company to the shiny digs of the Fishbowl.</p>
<p>Well, it wasn’t exactly shiny. The room was filled with six-foot folding
tables (we reffered to them as “lunch room tables”) and crummy office chairs
that were crept from unsuspecting classrooms. The rest of the room contained a
dizzying array of discarded PC’s, ethernet cable and various bits of
networking hardware.</p>
<p>Reguardless, this was heaven compared to where I had come from. My original
charter with the company had me driving to Land’s End in Dodgeville (about a
hour commute, which at the time seemed long) every day for about six months.
After that I filled various roles “in the field”, untill landing my more
permanent seat at Rayovac. I wrenched on that account for what seems like ten
years, but it was more like two. After living in the white-noise-corporate-
hell that was Rayovac, I was ready to move on to something that challenged
more than my patience and sanity.</p>
<p>The fishbowl just felt right. The only people with access were the most elite
of elite engineers, and our rock-star boss Bob (the first in a long series of
managers I would have named Bob). At this point in my life I had little to do
with myself beyond my work, so I spent day and night in the ‘bowl, tweaking on
ASP, Linux, SQL, whatever we could find a way to sell and was interesting
enough to loose sleep over.</p>
<p>We made a regular habit out of bailing out the “other” engineers in the
company. I would probably be retired in the Bahamas now if I had actually
gotten paid for the hours that we spent on-call, or in the office, or out in
the field recovering some abortion of a server upgrade that one of our
employees managed to get themselves into.</p>
<p>I remember one day looking out over the aurboritum from the second floor of
3113 and thinking about the future; I did this alot then, more than I do these
days. I thought about ways to take our little company and turn it into
something big, something that would leave a beautiful stain on the technology
world.</p>
<p>I had no idea.</p>
