<p>Could something akin to “Public Access Television” provide a solution to the
Net Neutrality debate?</p>
<p>(If you’re not familiar with <strong>Public Access Television</strong> , it’s a fascinating
subject.  This is a good place to start learning about it - <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_access_television" target="_blank">

<p>By providing free access to non-commercial services, Internet carriers would
then be free to apply surcharges and penalties to competing commercial traffic
without endangering the use of the Internet as an open means of information
sharing and communication.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this arrangement would encourage the development of non-
commercial services as an alternative to commercial systems and their
undesirable profit models of advertising and sharecropping.</p>
<p>Public Access Television is itself not without controversy, but it’s
interesting to look at if only to understand that there is a long history of
hoarding of communication technology by private industry, as well as people
fighting for its use in the public interest.</p>
