<p>This was a cool read because I wasn’t aware that there are people seeking
developers to come up with cool applications for this data.  When I wrote 3dna
I had hoped to encourage people to think about how they could explore their
genetic map in new and interesting ways, and it’s encouraging to know that
there’s other people out there thinking about the same thing (and even seeking
help doing so on Github).</p>

<p>If I can find the time I may follow-up on some of the links from the article
and see what I can contribute to those efforts.</p>
