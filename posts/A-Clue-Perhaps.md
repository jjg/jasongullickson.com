<div class="content">
<p>Did a few more experiments with the QU-BD extruder tonight and came to the
conclusion that the temperature being reported by the thermistor is probably
incorrect.</p>
<p>I thought more about what the filament looked like when I pulled it out of the
jam, and it wasn’t even hot to the touch, so tonight I reviewed my thermistor
table settings in the firmware to make sure I was using the correct settings.</p>
<p>Turns out I am, or at least ones that are close according to <a href="http://www.fabric8r.com/forums/showthread.php?728-Thermosistor-delta-values-
etc" target="_blank"> this post
</a> on the QU-BD forum (interestingly enough started by me, and the first
post to their forum…).  Of course I couldn’t just grab the actual table from
the manufacturer because they posted it as a PDF…so I’ll have to dissect
that on another machine (my Linux lab workstation doesn’t do PDF).</p>
<p>I’m going to give the manufacturer’s table a try, but I don’t have great
expectations.  Out of curiosity (i.e., rage) I cranked the heat up to an
indicated 260C and I was finally starting to smell melting PLA and pull
(jammed) filament out that was starting to melt.  I would have went further
but since I have to disassemble the extruder to reload it after a jam, I ran
out of time waiting for it to cool-down enough to take it apart.</p>
<p>I’m going to ask the QU-BD folks what the resistance should be at room temp as
well, because I have a feeling this thermistor is completely off the chart.</p>
