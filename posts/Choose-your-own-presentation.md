<p>A different presentation style that begins with questions from the audience.</p>
<p>Instead of a linear progression through a predetermined presentation.  The
presentation is broken into sections which correspond with the key topics or
points of interest.  When the presentation begins, the presenter asks the
audience for questions (presumably they are at the session because they have
questions on the topic; if not the presentation can be done in traditional
linear fashion).  Questions that are provided by the audience are then
answered by the presenter, with the aid accessing the pertinent components of
the presentation in random-access fashion.</p>
<p>This allows the presenter to prepare in advance for the presentation while
also accommodating the needs of individual audience members to get their
questions answered.  This also allows the audience to indicate their interest
level in various areas of the subject matter, allowing the presenter to
improve the presentations over time by increasing information in areas where
more curiosity lies and pruning areas of the presentation which represent less
interest.</p>
<p>This is also useful in gaining an understanding of the interest levels of a
group.  If used in a classroom, this method allows the instructor to gain
insight into the interest and experience level of the class on the subject.
This can then be used to enhance or alter focus of presentation of the
material to ensure that key concepts are delivered with enough emphasis
without over emphasizing things that are well-known territory for the group.</p>
<p>This method could be carried out with existing presentation methods, but it
could be enhanced by software that makes creating a “choose your own
adventure”-style presentation easier.  It would also be helpful for the
presentation software to gather metrics during the performance of the
presentation to capture what sections are presented and how much time is spent
on eacy.  Deeper functionality could be incorporated, such as audio/video
capture of the questions and topic coverage.  This would make it easier to
enhance the presentation as well as collect new questions to be answered.</p>
