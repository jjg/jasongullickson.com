<p>It was close but I didn’t quite hit one-post-per-day last month (29 out of
31).</p>
<p>It became clear that one per day wasn’t realistic, it’s just too easy to
forget and forcing a post just to hit the number is kind of dumb.</p>
<p>That said one post per day on <em>average</em> seems to be worthwhile, so I’ll try
that this month.  I think having the arbitrary goal has helped me publish
ideas that have been banging around for awhile but I’ve held-back writing up
because they were incomplete or I felt I couldn’t explain them well.  That’s
OK I guess, but I think a blog is a good way to get those ideas out there even
if they’re not perfect yet, and nothing stops you from re-publishing them once
they are in better shape.</p>
