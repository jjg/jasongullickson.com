<p>Another step in the right direction (?), the previous owner of “This Old
Honda” got a letter from the DMV requesting some sort of “Bond”. I’m not sure
what that’s all about, but Dan said he did, so I guess that’s progress?</p>
<p>Anyway, some good news; the film is coming along fine. We’re deep in post and
planning on shooting some “supplementary” footage in a couple of weeks that
should wrap up just about all of the loose ends we have on the photography
front. I’ve also been working on the score with our “court composer” Derek
Schyvinck and we seem to be on the same wavelength.</p>
<p>I’m hoping we will have a “teaser” available in the next month or so to share,
but our focus at the moment is solidly on getting all remaining footage in the
can so we can focus on the edit. That said, we could all use something to
“point at” when we’re discussing the film and I’m sure Matt could use a break
from cutting interview footage.</p>
<p>In the meantime, go riding, it’s beautiful out there!</p>
