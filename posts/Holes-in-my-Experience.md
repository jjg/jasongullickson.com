<p>It might not seem like it, but this was one of the things I was most worried
about on today’s project.</p>
<p>For some reason I’ve been avoiding drilling holes in round steel.  I don’t
know what got me paranoid about it but for some reason I’ve been freaked about
doing it and thought it would be harder than it is.</p>
<p>Aside from finishing this step of the project, getting over it makes it
possible for me to take steps in other projects that require the same task.  I
may finally complete the second 3D printer I started a few years back.</p>
<p>This happens to me often, getting hung-up on the fear of failing at some basic
task without really understanding why.  Most of the time the cost of failure
is low, and when I eventually just try to do it, it works out, so I don’t know
where this comes from.</p>
<p>I’m going to try to identify these hang-ups more deliberately and like today,
drag them into an arena where the stakes are low so I can get over them, or
have a real reason to avoid them.</p>
