<p>When you suddenly remember you need to send that email, or feel inspired to
tweet a message or share that photo on Facebook what is the first thing you
see when you open that application or website? Chances are it is a list of
other photos, updates, messages or posts.</p>
<p>How often do you fire up your mail application with the intention of writing a
message but find yourself distracted by a list of new messages? It happens to
me daily, to the point were I often forget to write the message I intended to
write in the first place.</p>
<p>This is a design flaw.</p>
<p>Our marketing folks spend a lot of time determining our websites visitors
intent in order to present the visitor with the most appropriate parts of our
service, and I think other applications could benefit from this technique as
well. This might not seem like an easy task, especially when we are used to
combining multiple functions (the reading and writing of messages, for
example) into a single application, but perhaps the solution is to decouple
these activities; after all you don’t open your notebook to read the (snail)
mail, and you don’t sit down at a piano to listen to your favorite
recordings…</p>
