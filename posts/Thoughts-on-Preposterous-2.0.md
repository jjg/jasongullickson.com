<div class="content">
<p>As bugs fall and new features are rolled out, I’m working out what’s left to
be done before Preposterous 2.0 can be considered complete.  Personally, I
want Preposterous 2.0 to be something I can replace my existing Wordpress blog
with so with that in mind, here’s what I think needs to be done:</p>
<p><strong>Delete support</strong></p>
<p>Right now you can effectively delete a post by sending an empty email with the
same title, but this doesn’t remove the post from the post index.  If I can
make this happen, then Preposterous will have complete CRUD support.</p>
<p><strong>Custom domains</strong></p>
<p>Since I’ll be replacing the blog currently at <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com" target="_blank">
http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com </a>
I’ll need to sort out the best way to go about implementing custom domains.
Since Preposterous generates static files this should be pretty
straightforward, but there’s a few ways to do it and I’d like to see if I can
automate the process so I can make it available to other users as well without
having to manually manage configurations, etc.  It also brings up the issue of
customizing things like the blog templates, etc. which I have ideas for but
haven’t completely tested yet.</p>
<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure if comment support is going to be a requirement of Preposterous
2.0.  I know how I <em>want</em> to add support for comments, but I haven’t figured
out exactly how to go about it yet.  I’m also not convinced that comments are
necessary, and they certainly are not without consequences.  If I can get the
implementation I have in mind working I might include it in 2.0 but I’m not
going to hold back the release for it.</p>
<p>In addition to the things I need out of 2.0, there’s a number of things I’d
like to include to make Preposterous better for all users, and especially for
new ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better documentation for users</li>
<li>Better notification emails</li>
<li>Better support for attachments (inline and otherwise)</li>
<li>Acknowledgements (give credit where credit is due)

<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m also looking for feedback and suggestions from existing or potential
users.  If there’s something you’d like to see in Preposterous 2.0 or future
releases, reach out to <a href="https://twitter.com/preposterous_me" target="_blank"> @preposterous_me
