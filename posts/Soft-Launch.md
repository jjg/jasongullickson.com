<div class="content">
<p>As discussed on the <a href="/about">about</a> page, this site will eventually contain every piece of content I’ve created.  Currently I’m in the process of writing software to translate this content from it’s various existing forms into a format my new blog software (<a href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank">Hugo</a>) can understand.</p>
<p>In the meantime I’ll be authoring new content as well, and at some point I’ll make a more pronouced annoucement about the (re)launch of <a href="https://jasongullickson.com" target="_blank">jasongullickson.com</a>.</p>
<p>Until then I’ll leave the existing <a href="https://jjg.2soc.net" target="_blank">Gullickson Laboratories</a> site up, but eventually, once the content has been ingested here, I’ll turn it into some kind of redirect to this site.</p>
