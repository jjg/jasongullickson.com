Back when I owned gullicksonlaboratories.com I used to do a (Friday?) post of
links to cool things I found over the course of the week. This got to be a bit
tedious because I’d try to write at least a sentence or two about each link
and include an image as well, and frankly some weeks I just didn’t
find/remember very many cool things.

  

That said it was a nice way to share some of the things I thought were worth
sharing, and it also gave me a way to find my own way back to some of these
these things as well. So in an effort to improve on the process, I’m going to
take a stab at doing a monthly post of links with only as much metadata as I
feel inspired to include.

  

Without further ado, **Cool Shit 12/2020**
