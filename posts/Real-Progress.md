<p>I can’t express how excited I am to finally put <a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposterous/issues/47" target="_blank"> Issue #47
</a> to bed.  That one really
irked me, it made everything that I wrote in Gmail look like crap, and since
I’m using a Chromebook as my “daily driver” that was pretty much everything of
substance that I posted.</p>
<p>The other major source of posts is the camera on my iPhone, which
unfortunately still has an <a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposterous/issues/48" target="_blank"> open Issue
</a> .  I’m less concerned about
this than I was before tonight however since the problem seems to have more to
do with dubious engineering choices on Apple’s part than on how Preposterous
is handling the post data, and while I do plan to address this I don’t feel
like it’s all my fault anymore.</p>
<p>Regardless I feel like I can start using Preposterous in earnest again, and
this is encouraging work to explore taking it to the next level.  I’d love to
be able to devote more time to developing Preposterous as well as return to
using it as the root of my public Internet presence.  I’ll be moving
Preposterous to a new more concise domain name soon, and working to make it a
more complete blogging platform without compromising its deliberate
simplicity.  More on that soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime expect to see more posts here more regularly and stay tuned
for updates on what’s coming down the line.</p>
