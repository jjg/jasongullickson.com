<p>About a month after seeing smoke pouring from the hot-end of my Reprap Prusa,
we’re printing again.</p>

<p>The crazy part is that the repair was little more than two hours of work (1
hour of diagnostics + 1 hour of actual fixing).  What took a month was
recovering the gumption lost watching the machine fail.</p>
<p>Building and operating a RepRap has taught me so many things.  Most of them I
had already known to some extent (electrical, mechanical and software
engineering, etc.) but also many other more abstract things that I had less
deliberate knowledge of.</p>
<p>The value of community support, of collaborating without overhead and how
determination doesn’t mean crashing into the same wall relentlessly.  That
somehow stopping to stare at the wall for a month gives you a chance to see a
crack, a cleavage point where you can strike with 1/1000th of the force and
the wall just falls away.  These are the ideas I want to encapsulate and
communicate in my RepRap book.</p>
