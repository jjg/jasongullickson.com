<div class="content">
<p>After years of wonderful service the future of <a href="http://jasongullickson.posterous.com" target="_blank"> posterous.com
</a> (my current blog host) is coming into
question due to an acquisition by <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank"> Twitter </a> . In light
of this I will finally be getting around to bringing my blog back in-house,
here to Gullickson Laboratories.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time I’ve hosted my own blog, in fact my first blog was
hosted at jasongullickson.com, on blogging software I wrote myself before the
widespread use of the word “blog” existed. Unfortunately little remains of
that initial series of posts, but if I ever find them I’ll add them to the
backlog here.</p>
<p>After the original Skylab fell (thanks to Charter Communications shutting down
inbound traffic to port 80), I switched to hosting my sites elsewhere and at
one point off-the-shelf blogging software was good enough that I stopped
hosting that content myself. This lead to livejournal, blogger, Wordpress and
eventually posterous.</p>
<p>Posterous was so easy that I was hooked after day one. Needless to say when I
brought <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com" target="_blank"> gullicksonlaboratories.com </a>
online I saw little reason to move the blog and happily kept it hosted abroad.</p>
<p>However the time has come, and having setup a self-hosted Wordpress site for
several others I decided it was time to do the same for myself. Perhaps as i
become more familiar with Wordpress I may expand the use of it to other
aspects of gullicksonlaboratories.com, but only time will tell.</p>
<p>For now all future blog posts will be landing here, and I will be bringing
over any interesting posts which currently reside elsewhere (as time allows).</p>
