<p>Running an Internet mailserver isn’t what it used to be.</p>
<p>I found out today that Google is rejecting emails from Preposter.us.  Not
flagging them as spam, flat-out rejecting them at the gate.</p>
<p>Through digging into this I learned a lot about all of the crazy contortions
that email goes through today in order to make it from one keyboard to another
screen.  It’s pretty wild, certainly a proper organism and I’d say that if
intelligence is going to become an emergent phenomenon on the Internet, the
seed crystal is going to be in the mail system.</p>
<p>Wonder and awe aside, I think I got to the bottom of the problem, an outdated
reverse DNS record, but I fear that anyone who may have attempted to try out
Preposter.us since the departure from Gmail may not be receiving notifications
for their posts.  If this is you, please try again and if you continue to have
trouble reach out on twitter to @jasonbot2000.</p>
