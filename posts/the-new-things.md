﻿  I’ve been struggling with a number of projects and I’m beginning to wonder
if the problem is that I should be focusing on _the new things_ .

Much of my work, my “ _innovation_ ”, comes from studying old things and
understanding what happened to them. Often there is unexplored potential in
these old things, but for one reason or another those paths were not pursued.

  

So some of my projects are about pursuing those paths, and in the process I
sometimes get lured by nostalgia (if that’s possible for things you’ve never
done before?). It’s sometime easy to believe that maybe the old ways were just
better and we could “fix” now by simply going back...

But you can’t go back, and I think that’s what hamstrings my efforts to
realize projects that are mostly an effort to recreate the past.

  

Instead, where I should be focused is applying what I’ve learned from the
study and practice of exploring these old things to create something new.
Something that belongs in _this_ world because it is born of this time, not
revived from a past that no longer exists or an attempt to turn back the
clock.

  

How this applies in practice will take some further analysis, but
acknowledging the problem is the first step.
