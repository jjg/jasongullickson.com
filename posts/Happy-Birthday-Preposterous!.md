<p>It was one year ago today that Preposterous went on-line.  I christened the
event with this well-crafted post:</p>
<p><a href="http://jason.gullickson.preposter.us/pirst-fost.html" target="_blank"> http://jason.gullickson.preposter.us/pirst-fost.html
</a></p>
<p>Over the course of the last year Preposterous has grown in irregular and
unpredictable spurts, but I’m happy to say that after spending considerable
time elsewhere I have returned to working on Preposterous in earnest and have
some fairly ambitious plans for the next year.</p>
<p>In my experience if you can keep anything alive for two years there is a very
strong chance that it will continue on and grow, and if you can’t then the
chances of the project going anywhere are significantly diminished.  Here’s to
hoping that what I have in mind doesn’t kill us before this time next year.</p>
