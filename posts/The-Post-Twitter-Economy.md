<p>I’ll be honest, this has nothing directly to do with economies but it just
rolled off the “tongue” nicely.</p>
<p>It appears that Twitter’s decline into “burning the brand” is no longer a
prediction but a meaurable fact.  Naturally this leads to thoughts of “what’s
next?“.</p>
<p>There’s certainly no shortage of Twitter work-alikes out there (I’m a user of
at least two) but to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes" target="_blank"> paraphrase Tyler Durden
</a> , “…I wonder if another
microblogging service is really the answer we need?“.</p>
<p>Indeed, stepping back a bit could the things we use Twitter for be better
served by something radically different?  Twitter was originally designed for
SMS after all, having bolted-on additonal functionality to the point where it
became useful for more than just letting your pals know which session you’re
attending at SXSW.</p>
<p>At this point it’s worth noting that for a long time this additonal
functionality was provided by third-party developers exclusively; the same
group that Twitter now chooses to alienate.</p>
<p>This perhaps provides the most direction for what might truely surpass
Twitter.  If Twitters fall was brought on by the choice to become hostile to
the developers who created its value in the first place, perhaps a successor
would have no such weakness by design; not just a benevolent overseer who
promises to play nice forever but an architecture which makes it impossible to
exclude developers from access to the system?</p>
