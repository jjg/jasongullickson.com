While I'm sick I can't do anything terribly productive, so I finally got around to writing a little program to import some ancient content into this blog.  I put very little effort into this (as I have very little capacity at the moment) but it's a start, and I can always improve it later right?

Sadly the best source I could find for these posts was the output from a previous effort to bring these back to life when my blog ran [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  I gave up on Hugo because I ran into problems cramming this much content into Git.  Hopefully that isn't still a problem (as I type this I'm watching `git push` slowly climb to 100%...).

Much fidelity is lost in this process.  Seems that most of the text and images remain, but there's lots of formatting problems.  Again I may go back and try to fix some of this, but some of these posts were pulled from [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org) so their original structure may just be lost to the ages.

One other significant issue is that for unknown reasons some of these posts didn't have a valid timestamp.  For these I simply sent them back to 1990 to make it clear that they are not in the proper order.

Why do this?  I think it's important to be honest about where I've come from and how my thinking has changed over time and experience.  I am a lot smarter and more sensitive than I was 20+ years ago, and I hope to continue improving in the future.  There is content in these posts that do not reflect how I feel today, but hopefully by sharing them I can show how people can grow and improve.
