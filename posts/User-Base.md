<p>The <a href="http://jjg.2soc.net/post/crypton" target="_blank"> Crypton </a> project is the first
software project I’ve had in a long time where I wanted to <em>use</em> the software
even more than I wanted to <em>write</em> it.  That’s not to say I’m not enjoying
writing it, it’s kind of fascinating, but I’m <em>really</em> looking forward to
using it.</p>
<p>I think that’s the key to any great product, that it’s created by people who
are actually going to use it.  I don’t think that this guarantees that the
product will be great, but I think the opposite (products created by people
who will <em>never</em> use them) are almost always less than great at best.</p>
<p>Capitalists are very keen to point out the value of identifying the audience
for a product before investing too much in its development, but I think this
misses the mark.  Their concern isn’t with pleasing an audience, but simply
taking their money.  What I’m talking about meets that requirement, but goes
further by providing the audience with something they actually want as well as
something that meets their needs, because they participated in creating it.</p>
<p>In the case of Crypton it works out conveniently that someone who wants to use
it happens to be someone who can build it as well, and I think this is often
the case for many great products.  However this limits the range of products
to ones used by people who might be able to make them, and by definition that
leaves a lot of people unserved.</p>
<p>What’s needed is a methodology which cultivates products via their end-users,
somehow “mixing-in” the people necessary to bring the product into the world
while maintaining continuity with the users wants and needs.  Attempts have
been made at this but all the ones I’m familiar with prioritize something
other than the user in the process (cost, profit, marketability, etc.).</p>
<p>What is needed is <em>a process which is capable of creating a product with the
same level of quality it would have if created by one of its users.</em></p>
