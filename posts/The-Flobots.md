<p>I first heard the Flobots at <em>Target</em> .</p>
<p>I thought maybe it was Eminem, because that seemed like something that might
be playing at Target.  Listening closer thought it became obvious that there
was something more intelligent going on.</p>
<p>The song was “Handlebars”.  I don’t claim to know the artists intent, but to
me it is a song about the duality of power in the form of intelligence.  How
it can be good or evil and how sometimes it’s hard to differentiate, even when
it’s used the same way.  It struck a chord with me.</p>
<p>Once I figured out the name of the band I hunted down a copy of the album
containing “Handlebars”; “Fight With Tools”.  I was so moved by “Handlebars”
that I had high expectations for the rest of the album.  I was a little
surprised by the varied style of the music, it reminded me a little of the
rap-metal-funk we saw in the 1990’s but with something new as well, and
lyrically, it took me back to my punk-rock days.  It was like having Dead
Kennedy’s music that discussed events I was old enough to remember happening.</p>
<p>I anxiously awaited their next release and have to admit I was underwhelmed.
I wasn’t disappointed, it was still a good record, but it just didn’t resonate
with me the way FWT did.</p>
<p>Then “The Circle in the Square” came out.  For me this was an huge leap over
Survival Story and cemented for me that Flobots would be a band I’d be into
for a long time.</p>
<p>It’s hard to quantify what I love about this band, but that’s probably because
they are more than just a band.  Like a lot of my other favorite musicians,
music is just a way to get their thoughts and observations out there, and each
song turns into research and study, and in the case of the Flobots, connecting
with active movements in the world working on the kind of changes I want to
see happen.  Their latest effort underscores this aspect of the group, and
they are directly working to raise themselves (and I think other musicians as
well) above the world of entertainment and into something new entirely.</p>
<p>The #noenemies project ( <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/974127639/flobots-two-new-albums-
for-2016-noenemies" target="_blank"> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/974127639
/flobots-two-new-albums-for-2016-noenemies
</a> ) stands to be a prototype for other artists to rise above
simply being entertainers and revenue generators for an industry that has long
exploited them.  Using music as a tool to enable, not enslave.  It’s very
exciting and the kind of thing I’ve wanted to happen for a long time.</p>
<p>Take a few minutes to check out the Kickstarter project video and if you share
my enthusiasm back the project.  I’d love for the success of this project to
inspire other artists to go this route and eventually, those of us working for
“the machine” in other lines of work as well.</p>
