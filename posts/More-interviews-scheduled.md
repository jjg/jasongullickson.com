<p>We’ve got two major production events coming up, the first is an interview
session that we’ll be shooting with the two “mechanics” featured in the film
who will discuss their project bikes, their current progress and their
expectations for the next few months leading up to the spring ‘run.</p>
<p>Secondly we have secured an interview with Lyall Sharer (Sr.), one of the
Slimey Crud’s and owner of <a href="http://www.sharercycle.com/" target="_blank"> Sharer Cycle Center in Verona
</a> , WI. We are particularly excited about this
interview and hope to learn more about the origin of the run and the Slimey
Crud Motorcycle Gang.</p>
<p>In related events, our last documentary release, “ <a href="http://2soc.net/breakdown" target="_blank"> Breakdown
</a> “ has been selected by the <a href="http://www.beloitfilmfest.com" target="_blank"> Beloit International
Film Festival </a> and will be screening on
