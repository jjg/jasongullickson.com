<p>On a whim I ordered a <a href="http://www.mixtile.com/" target="_blank"> Mixtile </a> Gena from <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/Mixtile/mixtile-gena/" target="_blank"> Tindie
</a> because it looked
like a more open version of the guts inside my Pebble watch, and I’d love to
do things with my watch that it was never designed for.  It’s also a third of
the price of even the entry-level Pebble, so I thought it was worth checking
out, even though no documentation was available at the time (I figured when it
showed up there would have to be some by then).</p>
<p><img alt="IMG_2174.jpeg" src="/preposterous/assets/47-img_2174.jpeg"/></p>
<p>I figured wrong :)</p>
<p>The box showed up surprisingly quick, but contained the device wrapped in
bubblewrap and nothing more.  I did a quick search to see if any more info had
shown up on the web since I ordered but no luck, other that a couple forum
entries from <a href="http://www.mixtile.com/forum/questions-2" target="_blank"> similar lost souls </a>
.</p>
<p>Who needs instructions anyway?</p>
<p>I plugged it in and turned it on (guessing that you hold the single button on
the left, since the controls are almost identical to the Pebble) and it
started right up.  Here’s a terribly-shot video:</p>
<p>After a second or two a clock is displayed, and no surprise the top and bottom
buttons on the right of the unit scroll through a number of pre-installed
watchfaces.  Pressing the center button brings up a menu of features and of
course the one I’m most interested in, “Settings”.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of built-in “Pebblesque” features that look like they would just
work once the device is paired with a phone, but unfortunately there’s nothing
in the settings indicating that this can be done.  There is a Bluetooth on/off
switch, and when you turn it on and scan for Bluetooth devices with your phone
something shows up that you can pair with, but it never reaches “Connected”
state, and the device continues to instruct you to “Connect the phone” to use
the phone-related features.</p>
<p>So at the moment there’s not a lot I can do with it, but I’ll keep poking at
it and also see if I can get something out of the support community.  To be
clear the device has potential, especially if the company comes through on
their promise to provide the device firmware and API in an open-source way.
It appears to be fairly well made and the screen is very nice in ambient light
(the back lighting seems a little weak but I haven’t tested that extensively),
and works well in sunlight as well as regular artificial light.  Performance
is snappy with the built-in firmware and although I can’t do a lot with it
yet, it doesn’t have that sluggishness you get with so many cheap gadgets.</p>
<p>Even if developing software for the device doesn’t materialize (or requires
some cumbersome toolchain) if the Gena does what it looks like it can do (once
properly paired with a phone) will do most of what I use my Pebble for, at a
price that will make it accessible to a much wider audience.  With a handmade
or 3D printed case &amp; band the whole investment could easily come in under $40,
which is getting into Casio Databank range…</p>
<p>…and if Mixtile does come through with an open-source development kit, it
could not only open up previously imagined applications but it could also
become a watch that could be used with devices other than smartphones.  Other
phones (feature phones or even basic flips) could theoretically use the Gena
as a display for incoming texts, etc. and in the reverse as a controller input
for music playback, call management, etc.  This would significantly lower the
cost-of-entry in using a “smartwatch” and dramatically increase the world
audience for these devices, so it’s an exciting proposition.</p>
