<p>The hard part about privacy is that it’s only as secure as the weakest link.
The technology is well established, but it only works if the people you want
to talk to are using the same thing you are.</p>
<p>Getting people to switch, especially if there’s a financial cost involved
(essentially a requirement to ensure privacy) is notoriously difficult due to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect" target="_blank"> the network effect </a> .
However I have an idea that is nothing more than a re-framing of the
relationship between a product and it’s customer that might help break this
effect.</p>
<p>Imagine a secure private message service akin to <a href="https://silentcircle.com/" target="_blank"> Silent Circle
</a> , etc., but instead of charging each user a
subscription fee to access the system, you sell a subscription that allows
each customer to add some number of other users for no additional cost.  This
allows someone with a strong personal interest in the product to start using
it without having to convince others to purchase additional subscriptions.</p>
<p>There is a secondary effect at work here as well.  When someone asks you to
sign up for something that is free, it can feel like a burden, but when
someone gives you a gift, one that would otherwise come with a financial cost,
people tend to look at that differently.  I imagine there is a formal
psychological term for this phenomenon.  What I’ve observed directly is that
people tend to be willing to invest more time in something proportional to
it’s cost.  So when you ask your friend to join a free service to talk to you
it may seem like a burden, but when you present them with a gift that would
otherwise cost them money, it’s both more compelling, and also carries an
obligation to at least try it out (to appreciate the gift).</p>
<p>The counter argument to a system like this is that it can be “gamed” or
otherwise exploited.  A group of people who want to get a better deal could
simply sign one person up and then split the monthly fee, effectively getting
away with something.  It’s probably obvious to you that is simply an socially-
orchestrated fall-back to the old one-subscription-per-user model.  If the
pricing for the service has been established correctly this has no negative
impact on the sustainability of the system, provides the subscribers with a
feeling of satisfaction and actually <em>reduces</em> operational cost compared to
the original one-bill-per-subscriber model by reducing the administrative
overhead of billing each account.</p>
<p>The key is to establish a system whose operational cost scales in-step with
paid-subscriber revenue, and a paid-subscriber to unpaid-subscriber ratio that
fits into this equation.  This might sound difficult but here again it’s
actually no different than the same service where each subscriber pays, except
that you multiply the subscription cost by the number of non-paying
subscribers each paying subscriber is allowed to grant free subscriptions to.
An interesting side-effect of this is that it is unlikely that every paid
subscriber will fill every unpaid subscriber “slot” they are granted, so the
revenue-per-paid-subscriber will actually be higher than a service which
requires every subscriber to be a paying subscriber.</p>
