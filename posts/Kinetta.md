<p>I remember reading excitedly about the Kinetta back in 2004.  Today the
general specs seem fairly run-of-the-mill, but as an expressive tool I know of
nothing contemporary that comes close.</p>
<p>Too bad.</p>
<p>I wonder if I could talk the company into release the design documents if they
don’t intend to resume work on the project.</p>
