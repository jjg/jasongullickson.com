<div class="content">
<p>Posts from my <a href="/tags/evernote">Evernote</a> archive are now avaliable, many for the first time in over a decade!</p>
<p>This one was particularly exciting becuase it includes posts from every previous incarnation of jasongullickson.com as well as the original Gullickson Laboratories blog, a journal I kept during the making of American Cafe and many other sources going all the way back to the year 2000 (about 200 posts in all).</p>
<p>As with previous archives, these posts are not perfectly preserved (notably all images are missing).  Iâ€™m working on extracting these from the Evernote archive file but for now the words will have to speak for themselves.</p>
