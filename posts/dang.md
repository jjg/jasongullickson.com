I have been working on so many wild things over the last month, but haven’t
had a chance to post a single thing about them.

  

Part of it is the new working arrangement, and part of it has been _everything
else_ that goes along with this time of year. I’ve started a number of posts,
but never find time to finish them properly. Perhaps that’s part of the
problem?

  

I think in February I’m going to try putting less focus on polish and more
focus on just posting something, even if it’s just pictures. I want to get
better about sharing what I’m learning and keeping some sort of record of the
projects I’m spending so much time on.
