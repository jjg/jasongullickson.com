<p>My open-source Pebble watch project Octowatch ( <a href="https://github.com/jjg/octowatch" target="_blank">
https://github.com/jjg/octowatch </a> ) was
mentioned in an interview with  Gina  Häußge,  creator of Octoprint ( <a href="http://octoprint.org" target="_blank">
http://octoprint.org </a> ) in volume 42 of Make Magazine.</p>

<p>Octoprint is web-based “host” software for controlling a 3D printer designed
to run on small Linux computers like the Raspberry Pi and let’s you control
the printer using any device on the network with a web browser.</p>
<p>Octowatch uses Octoprint’s API to extend a portion of this monitoring and
control to the Pebble smartwatch, allowing you to monitor (and soon, control)
the printer from your wrist.</p>
<p>For me it’s very exciting to have my work show up in Make and especially when
it’s a project that I feel came about the way I think all products should in
the future.  Octowatch came about to meet a personal need of mine, and is only
possible because of the open nature of Octoprint and the freely-available
Pebble development tools.</p>
<p>The whole experience has re-invigorated me to continue work on Octowatch and
to avoid hesitation when inspiration strikes for projects like this in the
future.</p>
