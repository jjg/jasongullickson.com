<div class="content">
<p>My first pass at importing posts from <a href="/tags/gullicksonlaboratories">Gullickson Laboratories</a> is complete!</p>
<p>There’s still some clean-up to do (in particular, self-referential links still point to the old site) but I didn’t want to delay making the content live any longer as the WordPress site will go offline in about a month.</p>
<p>I’m still working on a good way to redirect external links to this content.  Right now I’m planning to simply point the old hostname <a href="http://jjg.2soc.net" target="_blank">jjg.2soc.net</a> at this site, but if I can find a way to make the old links work more transparently (without a lot of plumbing) I’ll try to get that in place before shutting down the existing site.</p>
