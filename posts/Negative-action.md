<p>This is an important one to me so expect to hear more about it later.</p>
<p>Something occurred to me awhile back when we were fighting against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act" target="_blank"> SOPA
</a> , and it applies to
any policy or politics that are affect the Internet, or any technology in
general.</p>
<p>The frustrating thing about these policies is that they are often not defined
or ratified by the people most affected by them.  It’s important to remember
that these people can’t implement these policies themselves.</p>
<p>Past generations of my brothers and sisters have laid the tracks on which run
the most powerful engines of imagination in history.  They carry the
intellectual cargo of our past to the hungry minds of future generations.  The
name of this railway is <em>“The Internet”</em> .</p>
<p>We information technology workers are the only ones who can actually make
these policies real.  Congresspeople can’t configure a router, the CEO of the
phone company doesn’t write code, and the President of the United States
doesn’t haul cable.  I understand that not all of us may agree about the
sociopolitical aspects of how the network is used, but as engineers and
scientists we can agree on how the network itself should run.  By refusing to
make changes to the Internet that make it a worse <em>network</em> , we can eliminate
the most sinister of these policies.  Moreover, we will be able to maintain
our integrity as professionals as well.</p>
<p>It is key that we do this together.  If everyone who possesses the skills to
manipulate the workings of the network holds themselves to this professional
standard, and refuses to pass these skills on to others unless they too uphold
this commitment, the future of the network is secure.  If not we are in for an
uphill battle, and energy will that could be used to make things better will
be wasted pushing against those willing to compromise the integrity of the
network for personal gain.</p>
<p>This is something we can do without force, without violence and without
bloodshed but instead by holding our power in restraint.</p>
