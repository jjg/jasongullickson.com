<p>I <em>thought</em> I had this problem licked, but based on the way my last post
looks, I had not.</p>
<p>There is an issue with the way the built-in iOS email client sends messages
that causes <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> to treat them like HTML
formatted messages even when there’s no HTML formatting.  The result is a
giant block of text.</p>
<p>I’ve created a Github issue ( <a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposter.us/issues/56" target="_blank"> https://github.com/jjg/preposter.us/issues/56
</a> ) to look into it again, but
in the meantime I’m experimenting with ways to work around it (I believe
including deliberate formatting in the message will do the trick).</p>
