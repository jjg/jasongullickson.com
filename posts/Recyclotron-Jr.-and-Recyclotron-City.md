<p>For the last few months Jamie has been adding the occasional non-book-things
to our free little library.  Sometimes these are toys, or art or other
interesting things that find a home with one of the patrons from the
neighborhood.</p>
<p>In a way this is a sort of embryonic version of a more ambitious project we’ve
been noodling on we call the Recyclotron, but the Recyclotron is a bit more
sophisticated and is designed primarily to find loving homes for things that
might otherwise end up in a landfill.  Someday we’ll get around to building
one, but in the meantime this has been an interesting experiment along similar
lines.</p>
<p>Recently Jamie put a few near-foodstuffs in the library (some k-cups), things
we tried and decided we didn’t like, or things we received more than we could
use, etc.  This made me wonder what it would be like if every house on our
street had a little box out front used the same way.  The street would become
something of a shop, stocked with otherwise unwanted items, available at no
cost to the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Imagine if you were working on a project around the house and you needed a
part, or if you were working in the kitchen and you needed an ingredient, or
perhaps a painting and you need another brush…you get the idea.  What if
instead of heading out for Wal-Mart or having to wait for something via mail-
order you could take a stroll down the street and perhaps find just what you
need available for free?  Even if you don’t find what you’re looking for maybe
you find something else interesting, or maybe you just end up going for a nice
little walk, regardless of the outcome the experience is positive, and you can
always run to the store anyway if you don’t find what you need.</p>
<p>This seems like such a good and obvious idea that I’m sure someone else has
thought of it, and perhaps even implemented it somewhere, but nothing comes to
mind (if you know of such a thing please share).  There may be potential
downsides but nothing jumps out at me, especially if these boxes are located
on their owner’s property (preventing them from becoming dumping grounds,
which might happen if they are centralized on shared land) and if the size is
somewhat dictated they would be naturally self-regulating in terms of contents
and aesthetics (hard to park a Camaro on blocks inside one).  It seems
something like this would be particularly valuable in something like a “tiny
house” neighborhood, where storage is at a premium.</p>
<p>I’m curious what others think of this idea, is it something you’d welcome to
your neighborhood, or is there some downside that isn’t apparent?  I’ll be
thinking about how to extend our experiment and measure the results, but if
you have thoughts or know of other similar efforts we’d love to hear about
them.</p>
