<p>It’s almost 24 hours since the polls closed and we still don’t know who the
next president will be. We have our results in (not exactly an impressive turn
out, I might add…but then again my line was down for the last day or so),
but it seems the ancient system used to tally the national votes could use
some help.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here is the most interesting reply I recieved to my message
about our test poll. I’ve left out the authors email address, so please direct
all hate mail to me and I’ll make sure he gets it.</p>
<p><em>I always knew…</em></p>
<p><em>You were into politics. I hate all the side tracking bullshit topics that all
canidates use to win votes. I saw Al Gore in madison when he came. Everyone on
the stage behind him prompted everyone in the audience with flags and banners
when to clap and say, “ Ya Gore you rock!” It reminded me of a brain washed
cult. America, the independent nation. I would love to be proud of america and
it’s acheivements of dominating the globe with brutal tactics and greed driven
wars. Only we try to cover up these wonderful truths. If any president was as
cool to admit we rule ‘cause we can, I would vote for him. I can handle the
truth, can you? What I’m saying is I’m voting for violence in the media, porn
on the internet, and school shootings.</em></p>
<p>…and they said the american public was apathetic…</p>
