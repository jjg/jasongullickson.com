<div class="content">
<p>The idle issue was solved today with some timing adjustments and cleaning of
the mechanical advance mechanism.</p>
<p>The fuel leak has been located and can safely be ignored*.</p>
<p>The remaining issues are a minor missing/backfiring issue at <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> throttle-ish
and the back brake has this “grabby” thing going on (who uses back brakes?). I
have almost two miles on the bike now, all of them up-and-down the street in
front of my house (much to the joy of my neighbors, I’m sure).</p>
<p>The thing is loud, almost painfully so. I’m open to (cheap, fast and easy)
suggestions but chances are that I won’t bother with it until after the run.</p>
<p>At this point I think I’m done until the bike can be on the street legally. I
need to do a longer road test to figure out if the jetting is where it needs
to be but I’m chicken to do it until I have a plate on the back. It would be a
different story if I lived in the country…</p>
<p>*for the time being, it only leaks when the petcock is open and the bike isn’t running.</p>
