<div class="content">
<p>Is the weird “A”-like character that’s been showing up in my recent posts
specific to posts I make from my Chromebook?  I’m writing this from iOS to see
if it still shows up.</p>
<p>I see in old posts the character isn’t there, so if it’s <em>not</em> chromeOS or
maybe gmail <strong>web</strong> client specific, it is a true mystery.</p>
<p>Let’s see!</p>
