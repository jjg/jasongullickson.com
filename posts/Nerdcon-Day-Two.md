<div class="content">
<p>Learning a lot about authenticity.  I never looked at writing fiction as a
process of interacting with the characters in your story as <em>people</em> .  This
is probably why I’ve never been able to write more than a few pages of
fiction.</p>
<p>Looking forward to applying what I’ve learned (hopefully I can remember it) to
some existing story idea as well as a few new ones that have come up during
the con.</p>
<p>The even has also helped me understand more about what works for me in regard
to interacting with groups of people and events like this.</p>
<p>Overall I’ve learned a lot so far.</p>
