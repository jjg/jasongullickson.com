<p>I think <a href="http://ebay.com" target="_blank"> Ebay </a> is the number one reason owning a motorcycle
like this is possible. When I say “a motorcycle like this” what I mean is
owning a bike that is old enough to qualify for “classic” plates without
spending more money on getting it running than you would pay to buy a similar
new bike.</p>
<p>For example…</p>
<p>When I was a teenager my first bike was a <a href="http://beaver.vinu.edu/650.htm" target="_blank"> 1976 Yamaha XS650
</a> (the “Custom”, I believe). I bought the bike
for $125.00 from an ad in the Janesville Gazette. The bike was drivable and I
was able to ride it home that day. When I got there I started going over the
bike to see what needed to be done. All the typical items (tires, battery,
etc.) looked like they would need replacement but in addition there were a few
things I didn’t expect as well. In particular, the lever for the choke was
missing.</p>
<p>Now this is a tiny piece of metal with a little bit of a rubber/plastic handle
on it and a mounting screw. Based on this I figured it would cost about $5.00
at most so I called up the local parts shop to have them order it. You can
imagine my surprise when the total came to about $40.00.</p>
<p>That’s just crazy!</p>
<p>As it turned out, this was just the beginning of the pain as the bike would
later need a new airbox, rectifier and other various items which had they been
ordered directly from the parts place would have easily put the cost of the
bike over the $1000.00 mark, and that’s before replacing the tires and the
battery.</p>
<p>Needless to say buying these parts just wasn’t in the cards on my Musicland
salary and I had to improvise, leading to additional “learning experiences”
down the road; but I digress.</p>
<p>Had Ebay existed back then, things might have been different.</p>
<p>The bike I’m working on now, my CL350, came with a few “questionable” or just
plain broken parts as well. I noticed that in addition to the rust the exhaust
system has suffered there was also a bracket that was just plain broken. It
might be possible for me to fabricate a replacement but it just so happens
that I was able to find a NOS (New old-stock) piece on Ebay for about $5.00
(yes I see the irony in the pricing). The stator cover was also damaged at
some point (from the looks of it, pierced by the shift lever when the bike
went down on the left side). The cover has been repaired with what appears to
be JB Weld, but since I was able to find a replacement one for $6.00 on Ebay I
picked it up, I’ll keep the original as a spare.</p>

I was also able to find a NOS shift lever (the one I have is still a bit
crooked and missing the rubber bits) but at $15.00 it’s just a little more
than the part is worth to me, at least for now. I’ll wait until a better bit
comes along.</p>
<p>I’m sure that Ebay is just as much a boon to those selling these items as it
is to people like me buying them. Now that box of parts in their garage can be
turned into cash for other projects, and I know I feel better about
contributing to that than the insane markup of a parts dealer.</p>
