As much as I’d rather be building supercomputers, there seems to be an
increasing need for “smart” devices that respect people’s privacy. I’ve been
working on such things, but reached a point where I needed to invest
significant time and other resources to continue and I wasn’t sure how
valuable the work would be beyond my own interest. It seemed like people were
satisfied with the trade-off of surveillance for convenience.

  

_However_ I’ve had a few conversations lately driven by a continuous stream of
escalating nastiness on the part of these “smart device” vendors that has me
reconsidering my de-prioritization of these projects.

So I’ve picked up a little bit of hardware and I’m going to set-aside some
time to build some prototypes. I was able to find some dev boards that have
most of what I need for the initial devices so I can focus mostly on the
software for now. Once that’s ready I can turn to designing & building custom
open hardware catered to each type of device.

  

Coincidentally one of these prototypes (a replacement for the Ring doorbell)
shares components with another mothballed project, so work here produces
double-value. That’s always a nice bonus.
