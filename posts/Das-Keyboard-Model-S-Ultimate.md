<p>What is there to say?  If you need this and you already know about it, you
know it’s the right arrow for your quiver.</p>
<p>But for the uninitiated, the <a href="http://refer.ly/a2ym" target="_blank"> Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate
</a> is a proper full-sized keyboard featuring buckle-
spring mechanical keyswitches.  What does that mean?  It means it feels like a
finely-crafted instrument to type on, with both audible and tactile feedback
for each keystroke.</p>
<p>The Ultimate takes the sensory experience to a higher level by eliminating
legend from the keys entirely, forcing you to use your sense of touch and
well-trained hands to find the right keys and never take your eyes off the
work.</p>
<p>It’s hard to over-emphasise how good it feels to type on this keyboard.  It’s
akin to using a <a href="http://refer.ly/abWS" target="_blank"> finely-crafted power tool </a> , or a <a href="http://designspiration.net/image/477145408410/" target="_blank">
German Super-8 movie camera </a>
, or an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92" target="_blank"> Italian-made firearm </a> .</p>
<p>I’ve only spent about 15 minutes typing on the Model S so I’ll have to provide
a more complete review after a few million more keystrokes but the initial
impression is that this is an amazing tool that I can’t believe I waited this
long to try.  If you spend the majority of your time working with a keyboard
you owe it to yourself to take a Das Keyboard for a spin.</p>
