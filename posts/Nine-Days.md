<p>I took the bike out for an extended ride last night (on a closed course of
course…) and even was able to get a high-speed (60mph) run in there. There
seems to be some sort of missing/backfiring problem between 0-.25 throttle
which got worse toward the end of the ride. At first I thought it was maybe
the battery conking out but I checked it right away when I got home and it was
12.25 (which is impressive since it was 11 something when I left…the
charging system is working!). It also resembled a lack of fuel, but I think
there was plenty in the tank and in the lines as well.</p>
<p>I need to do some reading but it might be that the air screws are too tight,
making for a too-rich mixture around the crossover point where the carbs
switch from the idle to the main jets (and both are open), so it might be just
a matter of adjusting those screws, but you would think it would backfire at
idle if that was all there is to it.</p>
<p>In any event the bike went 60 without ejecting any parts, and then it stopped
as well. I have to say the handling is awesome (not that I pushed it too hard,
but it feels really good at speed). If I can get this one running problem
cleared up, and find out what’s up with that back brake…I think she’s done for
this phase.</p>
