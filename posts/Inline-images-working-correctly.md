<div class="content">
<p>One of the main things holding me back from migrating my existing Wordpress
blog at <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com" target="_blank"> http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com
</a> to Preposterous was an issue with the
way Preposterous rendered images (essentially ignoring the fact that they are
presented in-line with text).  I’m happy to announce that this bug has been
fixed, as you can see below:</p>
<p><img alt="Inline image 1" src="/preposterous/assets/143-tesla-roadster-01.jpg"/></p>
<p>I’m in the process of determining if there are any other barriers to migrating
my WP blog.  I’m very excited about the possibility of making the move, so any
other showstoppers I can come up with will be documented soon and with any
luck, dispatched with before the new year.</p>
