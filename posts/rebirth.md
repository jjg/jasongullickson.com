I’ve decided to bring [ Preposter.us ](http://Preposter.us) back from the
grave. Seems appropriate given that it’s October after all.

  

There’s a lot to do, but I’ve managed to migrate the repository to Codeberg,
re-purchase the domain name and get the server (somewhat) running again.

  

I can’t seem to add hyperlinks using the iOS mail client, so here’s a list of
links for reference:
