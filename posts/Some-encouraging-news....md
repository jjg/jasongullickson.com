<p>I got an email over the weekend from the bike’s previous owner. He has all the
paperwork done and in the mail to get the title squared away. I’m not sure
what this means time-wise, but at long last it looks like I’ll have a clear
title for the bike, which means I need to get my “rear in gear” and get these
carb issues under control.</p>
