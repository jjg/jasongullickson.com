It’s been a _wild_ few months and I haven’t written much of anything, let
alone as much as I would have wanted to.

  

There’s a lot going on, in the world, in the country and of course in the
laboratory. I have a few projects that have made significant progress since my
last update, and I feel bad about falling-behind in talking about them. I’m
not sure that will change anytime soon, but maybe winter will finally settle-
in and I’ll have fewer things to do outside.

  

Here’s some photos from the last few months...
