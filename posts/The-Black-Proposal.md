<p>It’s a good read, and it’s compelling that it was successful in garnering
investment.  I feel like a lot of the potential has gone unfulfilled, and a
generation or so later, I feel like we’ve lost a lot of ground in terms of
training programmers to make the most out of these supercomputer-style
architectures (which are now part of most consumer computing devices).</p>
<p>Reading this has inspired me to evaluate what a “sequel” to this proposal
might look like today.  Something that would inspire the current and future
generations of programmers to lay down the hoe and learn how to realize the
true potential of modern computing machinery, and turn those results over to
not only University scientists, but to everyone who has an idea that can be
explored more effectively through high-performance computing.</p>
