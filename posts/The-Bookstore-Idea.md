<p>Imagine a traditional bookstore, however when checking out, the shopper
receives an ebook instead of the physical book, and the physical book is
returned to the shelves.</p>
<p>Since the books never leave only one copy of each book needs to be stocked,
allowing more variety on the shelves. This combines the pleasure of the
bookstore experience with the selection of an online store and the convinience
(and ecological advantages) of electronic books.</p>
