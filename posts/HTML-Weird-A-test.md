<p>Looks like plain text-ish posts are <em>improved</em> but I see a lot of old posts
with weird questionmark-in-a-diamond things now, which <strong>isn’t encouraging</strong> .</p>
<p>I’m hoping that that doesn’t happen with this post.  Maybe it’s just some
weird old-fashioned thing?</p>
<p>Here’s to hoping.  Another sentence to test why not?</p>
