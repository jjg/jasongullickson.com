<p>Pieter mentioned an interesting device called <strong>AlphaSmart</strong> ( <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaSmart" target="_blank">
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaSmart
</a> ) on Twitter the other day.
It’s sort of an electronic typewriter/typing trainer and was apparently
popular in the education market.</p>

<p>It’s a neat device.  Small, rugged and with a long battery life, it would make
a nice tool for writing in the field.</p>
<p>Among other things it had an interesting “synchronization” mode where it could
be attached to a computer via the keyboard port and then dump the contents of
its memory into an editor on the computer as if it were a person typing the
data in.</p>
<p>This seems like something that could be recreated using an Arduino, so I’m
noodling on this and collecting some of the pertinent information here for
reference.</p>
