something very cool to encourage just this type of behavior, I’ve written a
little about it here: <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/test-the-market-for-your-tech-with-

<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andyrawson/ir-blue-thermal-
imaging-smartphone-accessory?ref=card" target="_blank"> IR-Blue </a> is a spot-on example of how products of
the future will be created.  It goes a little something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I need a product that is unobtainable (doesn’t exist, too expensive, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>I build one for myself</p></li>
<li><p>Other people want one</p></li>
<li><p>I crowdfund a production run (if the crowd supports it)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Rob needed a thermal imaging camera to use around the house but commercial
units (designed for commercial applications) were too expensive, so Rob
figured out how to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id
/Thermal-Imaging-Phone-Camera/" target="_blank"> build one himself </a> using more-or-less off-the-shelf components.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/pIb1scnD67o" target="_blank">http://youtu.be/pIb1scnD67o</a></p>
<p>As <a href="http://hackaday.com/2012/11/12/building-a-thermal-imaging-
sensor-from-scratch/" target="_blank"> word got out </a> about Rob’s project, it turned out Rob isn’t the only
person in the world that needs a non-commercial-grade thermal imaging camera.</p>
<p>A project like this is impractical to implement in mass amounts using off-the-
shelf parts, so Rob figures out what it would take to mass-produce them and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andyrawson
/ir-blue-thermal-imaging-smartphone-accessory?ref=card" target="_blank">
starts a Kickstarter project </a> .</p>
<p>If enough people need the product, the project gets funded and units get mass
produced.  If not, Rob still has the camera he needed, and can hand-make some
more for people who need one enough that the extra expense of a hand-made unit
is acceptable.</p>
<p><em>(in a perfect world Rob will have open-sourced the design, so if he isn’t
interested in continuing work on the project it can be picked up by others who
have different resources at their disposal; I’m not aware if Rob went this way
or not)</em></p>
<p>There are numerous advantages to this approach but I think the best is that it
applies Darwinism to the survival of products at their earliest stages, and
the cost of “failure” is almost eliminated (or at least can be).  Since Rob
needed the camera, and built one to meet his needs, if the product development
were to stop right at that point, nothing is lost.  If it continues, then
others benefit from Rob’s initial work, Rob benefits as well and the world is
a better place.</p>
<p>This also reduces the role of Advertising as a means of convincing the world
they need a product because a company has sunk millions into creating it and
now needs to generate revenue or suffer a loss.</p>
<p>The natural argument to this approach is to say that there is a ceiling on the
scale of product that this process can handle, and I agree that there are
things that simply are not reasonable for an individual to construct in their
garage, in their free time using their own financial and other resources.  I
have two counter-arguments to this:</p>
<p>The first is no argument at all, and to accept the fact that products “too
big” for this approach are perhaps bigger than what the world needs.
Certainly you can cite exceptions to this argument, however consider that the
scale of product that can be executed this way is a function of time, and
products that seem too big today will not be too big tomorrow (if you need
evidence of this consider 3D printing, digital computer or refrigeration).</p>
<p>The second argument is that it is our current mode of operation that limits
our ability to scale big products using small resources.  In reality, almost
every epic product comes from a small team, and it is only the antique
orientation toward mass production and other industrial revolution prejudices
that convince us that big things cannot come from small teams independently
backed and collaborating openly with others solving the same problems around
the world.</p>
<p>A second reservation some will have is “what if I don’t know how to build my
own?“.  This is a trickier bit and something I’ve working on providing
solutions for.  This is an important role I see hacker/makerspaces filling,
and I’m also <a href="https://github.com/jjg/pullstarter" target="_blank"> working on another project
</a> which is a sort of inverted-Kickstarter
designed to facilitate people with ideas but not necessarily the means to
connect with other individuals and help realize their products.</p>
