<div class="content">
<p>I’ve decided to build Crypton on <a href="https://github.com/jjg/jsfs" target="_blank"> JSFS </a> .</p>
<p>Originally I thought it would be faster to build it using a more traditional
API framework, or something like <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank"> Express </a> or <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank"> Flask
</a> , because it has a heavy client-side component as
well.</p>
<p>But after thinking hard about how the back-end should work, it became clear
that most of the work would be happening on the front-end.  Also, it’s the
back-end which presents the most vulnerable surface to attack, so it should be
as simple as possible, and the application shold rely on it as little as
possible.</p>
<p>This, coupled with my obvious familiarity with the platform made it apparent
that I should at least try to build it on top of JSFS.</p>
<p>I have a few more projects I’d like to wrap-up before diving deeper into
Crypton, also it’s one of those rare times of the year where the atmosphere
here is cooperative, so I’m not planning on getting started on this until that
changes.  However, come winter, I expect to be making some progress.</p>
<p>In the meantime I need to attract some fans, because I’m going to need a lot
of feedback and actual user mileage to get it right.</p>
