<p>Yeah, I’m taking my time getting the new mascot, merchandise, etc, but then
again I’m not so sure anyone is overly-anxious for this stuff anyway.</p>
<p>I watched <em>Flatliners</em> again the other night (which if you haven’t seen it,
it’s about some med students experimenting with coming back from the dead),
and it got me thinking about some work I had done when I was young analysing
bio-electrical signals, such as EKG, EEG, etc, so I decided to surf around a
bit and see what info I could find on this stuff, EEG in particular.</p>
<p>I had always wanted to build an EEG of some sort; the idea of capturing
brainwave data and manipulating it in software was always intrguing to me.
After some searching, I came across <a href="http://www.brainmaster.com" target="_blank"> www.brainmaster.com
</a> , where I found exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>The brainmaster is a box that you hook up to your serial port on one end, and
your head on the other, and it amplifies and digitizes brainwaves and sends
them to your computer. Some of the applications for this are biofeedback,
treating ADD, etc. In addition to more typical applications, something like
this could be used to send brain activity data to an application that maybe
interprets them and controls software, or hardware, or a coffee machine.</p>
<p>So, when I get back (I’m leaving for awhile), I’m going to start down the road
of building one of these boxes, and I’ll report my findings here, along with
detailed info on the projects page.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, merry xmas and happy new year, etc.</p>
