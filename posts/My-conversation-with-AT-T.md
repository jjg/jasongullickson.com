<p>Our DSL suddenly dropped from about 5Mbps to 175kbps.  I contacted AT&amp;T via
online chat, and after being told to restart the modem (and therefore the
conversation) twice, I had a long conversation with one of their “agents”:</p>
<p>System</p>
<p>Welcome Mr. Jason Gullickson.</p>
<p>System</p>
<p>Connecting to server. Please wait…</p>
<p>System</p>
<p>Connection with server established.</p>

<p>Frank</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting AT&amp;T Internet Support, my name is Frank(ak880s).I see
that I am chatting with Mr. Jason Gullickson . Am I correct?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I see that you provided XXXXXXXXXX as the number associated with your DSL/Dial
account.Am I correct?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>How are you doing Mr. Gullickson?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Thank you for confirming the details. How can I make you a very satisfied
customer today?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I’m supposed to be getting betweeen 3mbps and 6mbps download but I’m only
getting about 175kbps (or 1.28mbps according to speedtest.net)</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I just talked to another one of your agents who told me to remove my router
from the loop, so now I am jacked directly into the siemens speedstream modem
via ethernet</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I am sorry you are experiencing this issue and will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I appreciate your efforts.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>so it looks like it’s not the router, since I’m getting the same numbers; what
do we do next?</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, did you power cycle the modem?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, in order to assist you further, may I place you on hold for
approximately two minutes while I check my resources.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>ok, thanks for letting me know</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, please do not worry, I will do my best to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Please let me know the speed that are you getting right now?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I’ll re-run the test</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>1.31 mbps</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Sure, I also want to ensure that you performed the power cycle in the given
sequence :-</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Un-plug the power supply.</p>
<p>Un-plug the telephone cord from the modem.</p>
<p>Unplug the modem from all cables for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Plug the telephone cord to the modem.</p>
<p>Turn on the modem.</p>
<p>Wait for the DSL light to become solid green.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>yes, this is the sequence given to me by the previous agent</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>That’s great.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I believe there should be increase in the power cycle of the modem.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I mean in the speed.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I am sorry for my typo.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>so are you saying you want me to cycle it again?</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Nope, if you performed the power cycle in the given sequence then it is fine.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>good :) what’s next?</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Which Internet browser are you using? ( i.e. Internet Explorer, AT&amp;T Yahoo
browser, Firefox or Google Chrome etc)</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>Chrome at the moment (on OSX)</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>however my original tests didn’t involve a browser, I was reading SNMP data
from the router’s WAN port, and now I’m reading it off the computers ethernet
interface</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, are you using Mac Operating System?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, the slow speed issue is might be with the computer or browser
settings.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I really apologize, we do not have expertise with the mac operating system,
this issue is best resolved when working together with one of our support
agents over a telephone line because it requires multiple troubleshooting
steps. Please call us at 1-877-722-3755 We look forward to speaking with you
to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I’m certain it has nothing to do with the browser, I was experiencing this
download cap using other file download software</p>

<p>I’m certain it has nothing to do with the browser, I was experiencing this

<p>You</p>
<p>lost you for a second there Frank</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Yes, we have appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Yes, I am with you.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I am looking for your co-operation so that this issue can be resolve as soon
as possible.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>so yes, I don’t think this is a mac specific issue because I’ve noticed the
same problem with Windows machines on this network as well</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>It seems like it started a week or so ago, like somehow my account started
using a different, lower bandwidth plan</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Please do not worry, we appreciate your business and time.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>We want to resolve it with in time.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Please contact our voice support.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>why can’t we continue troubleshooting here?</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, we need to perform further trouble shooting steps to resolve
the issue and create the trouble ticket, I am documenting the case in such a
manner that you do not have to repeat yourself.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Please refer the case number :- 226343876</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>You’re not answering my question Frank</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Yes, we need to perform some troubleshooting steps ( browser optimize, LAN
settings, DNS flush etc), you are using the MAC Operating System and we do not
have expertise with the Mac.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Please contact our voice support, they will assist you further.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I have tried repeatedly to work with AT&amp;T phone support with zero success. I
am a programmer and a network engineer, I can find any setting, etc. you want
to know about on the Mac</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Yes, I appreciate your efforts. I apologize, the mac OS is not in our scope of
support and I can not perform troubleshooting beyond the scope of my chat
support limit.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>How about I bring up a Windows XP machine, can we continue then?</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Yes, we can continue but this will disconnect this chat session .</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>Actually it won’t, I’m all set</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, do you want to start a new chat session or contact our voice
support?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>No need to start a new session, I’m ready to troubleshoot on Windows XP</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>How did you change the computer?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I have an xp machine handy and plugged it into the modem, then connected the
mac (with the chat session) to a second ethernet port</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, the speedstream modem has only one Ethernet port.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>the second ethernet is on the Windows machine, not the modem</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I understand that there are two computer sharing the single Ethernet port, am
I correct?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>not exactly (although I’m not sure how this is relevant to the troubleshooting
task); the XP machine is plugged into the single ethernet port of the modem;
the mac is plugged into a second ethernet port on the XP machine; the XP
machine is bridging the connection to the Mac, but the XP machine is connected
directly to the ethernet port of the modem</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>In this scenario, please contact our voice support, the issue is with the
multiple computer sharing the same modem issue, it is one of the reason for
getting the slow speed.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>actually the performance tests were carried out with only one computer
connected, I only brought the second machine online at your request for a
Windows machine to troubleshoot</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>The benefit of the voice support is this we can restart the modem/computer as
per the troubleshooting steps without loosing the voice session.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Yes, I can see that the Mac computer is connected directly with the modem.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I understand the value of that flexibility. However has anything been done to
rule out a bottleneck between the modem and the internet? As several devices
on my network have poor network performance it is unlikely that the problem is
on one of these computers</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Yes, I can understand that I appreciate your computer knowledge, I am here to
assist you.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>We value your time as well, we can resolve the issue or create the trouble
ticket only after performing the all trouble shooting, we are not suppose the
line test before the trouble shooting ( power cycle the modem, disconnecting
the router or browser troubleshooting).</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>The slow speed issue is also may be due to the anti-virus applications or
maleware, router or modem firewall.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, the speed range of your High Speed Internet service is based
on the distance between your home/office and our network location, as well as
the condition of your line.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>The actual speed achieved will vary due to factors such as Internet congestion
and wiring inside your home/office. We need to perform various test to get the
root cause of the issue correctly.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>Very good, let’s perform some tests</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Other reason are the temporary files and cookies of the Internet browser or
any EMI device near the modem.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Sure, as you are using the two computer with the same modem, I appreciate if
you contact our voice support. Everything is documented in my case.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>It will be also best if you connect the windows XP computer with the modem and
perform the power cycle.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>This is the second time I’ve been asked to re-start the troubleshooting
process with another agent. How about this, if you’re willing to test the
line, and if that doesn’t provide any insight, I’ll attempt to contact AT&amp;T
voice support, deal?</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, I apologize, in this situation, it is not possible to run the
speed test, I will not get the good and correct results.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>I will be happy to chatting with you all day. We are here to resolve the
issue.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>That’s not the impression I’m getting Frank, if I understand correctly, the
only option you’re providing me with is to end this conversation and attempt
to contact voice support</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, I appreciate your patience, I would love to help you and we
are here for the same.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>However, we have some limitation over the chat support.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I believe we have arrived at an impasse; if you cannot (or are unwilling to)
test the line I don’t think there is anything more we can do here.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>We have some dedicated department for some specific technical issue like
wireless, Mac or gaming console etc.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>They are expertise on these stuffs.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>As I said before I can attest that the issue has nothing to do with these
individual devices, what I need is a network engineer or possibly a lineman.</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>I believe that the quickest way to resolve this issue is probably going to be
to find another internet service provider</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Yes, I understand that our voice agent will surely arrange the line technician
for you if required.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Mr. Gullickson, you are valuable for us and you will be always valuable, we do
not want to loose any of our member. I appreciate your patience again.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>Is there any thing else I may assist you with today?</p>
<p>You</p>
<p>Based on this conversation I believe there is not.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
<p>It was nice chatting with you.</p>
<p>Frank</p>
