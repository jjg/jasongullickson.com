<div class="content">
<p>In a quiet backstreet of San Franscisco, in the basement of an unassuming
laundry, one can find the dim, quiet retreat of those seeking <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/06/coder_s_high_the_intense_feeling_of_absorption_exclusive_to_programmers.html" target="_blank"> the
programmer’s high
</a>
.</p>
<p>Quiet and cool, these private clubs provide a safe place where programmers can
indulge themselves, surrounded only by others of their kind, for hours, days
or perhaps weeks on-end, engulfed in the bliss and serenity of uninterrupted
code.</p>
<p>Not open to the general public, membership requires passing an initiation that
is elementary for the initiated programmer, but sufficient to ward off
tourists, gawkers and pointy-haired bosses.  The only rules are a vow of
silence, and a “programmers only” constituency.  All who violate these tenets
are quietly asked to leave.</p>
<p>No talking, no phone calls and certainly no Google Hangouts, The Programming
Den is strictly for programming only.  Amenities vary from location to
location, some spartan in furnishment while others luxurious, with retail and
refreshments catered specifically to the hackerish clientele.  Staff work
quietly isolated from the programmers, and accommodations are provided for
members who need to make noise (sometimes phone booths and private rooms,
other times an alley behind the building).  The key affordance is room to
concentrate and ample Internet bandwidth.</p>
<p>As dens form like pools around the world where concentrations of programmers
grow, the only franchise agreements are that the rules above are adhered to,
so that travelling programmers can expect a welcoming environment anywhere
they find the SSID “the_programming_den”.</p>
