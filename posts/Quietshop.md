<div class="content">
<p>A coffeshop (or equivalent) where communications devices are checked at the
door.</p>
<p>The goal of a Quietshop is to provide a shelter from the distraction and
stress of constant connectivity.  When someone is visiting a Quietshop, the
expectation is that they are not immediately available, but they <em>can</em> be
reached in case of emergency.</p>
<p>A Quietshop is broken into at least three distinct spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>A common area where visitors can meet and converse</li>
<li>A quiet area where library rules apply</li>
<li>A reception area where communication devices are checked and monitored by the attendant

<br/></li>
</ul>
<p>Additional spaces of the same or other types may be available, but to meet the
definition of a Quietshop these three areas must be present and acoustically
isolated.</p>
<p>When visiting a Quietshop, you enter through the reception area where you are
greeted by an attendant who safely stores your communication devices in a
check area.  If your device demands attention during your visit (you can
define what that means for the attendant) the attendant will make a note of
the request and deliver it to you.  If you need to immediately respond to the
request, you can do so in the reception area.</p>
