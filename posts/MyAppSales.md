<p>Awhile back, maybe a few months ago I noticed a few apps showing up for iPhone
developers that make it easier to analyze app store sales.  Some of these apps
were desktop applications or web apps, but I was really only interested in
apps that ran on the phone itself.  If I wanted to use a “real” computer, I
could just use a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>One of the apps I found was <a href="http://www.drobnik.com/touch/my-
app-sales/" target="_blank"> MyAppSales </a> by <a href="http://www.drobnik.com/touch/" target="_blank"> Oliver Drobnik </a> (a.k.a. “Dr.
Touch”).  As you may know, Apple provides no public API for accessing app
store sales data and as I understand it, it’s “against the rules” to scrape
this data out of <a href="https://itunesconnect.apple.com/WebObjects/iTunesConnect.woa" target="_blank"> iTunes Connect
</a> , so Dr. Touch
was unable to get his app approved for sale via the App Store.  So instead, he
found a clever way to work around the (dis)approval process by selling the
source code for the application to developers directly, who could then compile
and install the code on the iPhone themselves.  Since the only market for the
app are other iPhone developers, this model works just fine.</p>
<p>I decided to purchase a copy of the app, but during the checkout process (via
PayPal), I received an unexpected message (related to the international nature
of the transaction) and I chickened out, not knowing much about Dr. Touch at
the time.</p>
<p>A few days later I was relieved that the purchase didn’t go through because I
found a lovely little app on the app store called “ <strong>Sales Tracker</strong> “.  The
screenshots looked beautiful, and while the price was high I was pretty sure
this was the app I had been waiting for.</p>
<p>After purchasing the app, I was somewhat disappointed.  The graphics that
looked so good in the screenshots didn’t necessarily do anything (notably a
cube on one of the screens seemed to serve no purpose) but it was giving me
some data and that was enough to put up with the limited functionality and
occasional crashes.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the end of the disappointment however.  A month or so later, I
wanted to use the backup-and-restore feature because I was going to wipe out
my phone to install the OS 3.0 beta and I was unable to figure out how to use
the restore function (the URL provided by the application didn’t work).  Worse
yet, when I emailed the developer I received no reply.  While I was having
trouble, so were other users as revealed by the increasingly negative reviews
on the app store, as well as rumors about questionable security and privacy
practices of the app’s developers.</p>
<p>The final straw came about a week ago.  The day after my latest release of <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/lent/" target="_blank">
Lent </a> went live and I was very
curious about how it faired in the store.  When I tried to open <strong>Sales
Tracker</strong> and update my data, it was unable to connect.  As it turns out, this
was a common problem across all applications like this due to a change Apple
had made to iTunes connect.</p>
<p>All the while, I had been following Dr. Touch on <a href="http://twitter.com/Dr_Touch" target="_blank"> Twitter
</a> and noticed that he too was having this problem
connecting with his <strong>MyAppSales</strong> app.  He described how he would address the
problem, but that he was on his honeymoon and it would have to wait until he
returned.  Not long after posting this message he wrote again, describing the
necessary fix and how you could modify the code yourself to address the issue.
Not more than a few hours later, the fix had been committed to the subversion
repository and that customers could fetch the patch immediately.</p>
<p>This was quite a contrast to the support provided for <strong>Sales Tracker</strong> .  I
decided right then to purchase a copy of <strong>MyAppSales</strong> .</p>
<p>I’ve been using <strong>MyAppSales</strong> for a few hours and I’m very happy with it.
It’s not quite as “pretty” as <strong>Sales Tracker</strong> , but there’s allot more
useful functionality and since I have the source, if I can’t get Dr. Touch to
address my needs, I can do it myself (although I hope he does continue to
update the app, he does wonderful work!).</p>
