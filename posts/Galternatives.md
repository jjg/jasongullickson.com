<div class="content">
<p>Last night something <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank"> Google </a> did something <em>particularly
evil</em> to my daughter (more on this later), so I’m looking for alternatives to
the Google services we currently rely on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gmail</p></li>
<li><p>Google Docs/Drive</p></li>
<li><p>Google Calendar</p></li>
<li><p>YouTube</p></li>
<li><p>Google+</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I think those are the big ones.  I’m sure there are other services that we use
in a less direct way (Google Checkout comes to mind) but by eliminating the
services above I think that related dependencies will go away as well or at
least their use will be pushed into obscurity.</p>
<p>Of all of them the one that seems the trickiest to replace is Google Docs.
There are of course hundreds (thousands?) of similar products but the ones
I’ve worked with have limitations that make them fall short of GD for our use
cases.  One thing that might replace GD for us (and in many ways surpass it’s
capabilities) is <a href="http://ipython.org" target="_blank"> iPython </a> , but I need to play with
that some more to see if it will do what we need and serve all the platforms
we commonly use.</p>
