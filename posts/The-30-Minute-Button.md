<p>This button is an exercise in seeing how quickly I could produce something
useful with my Reprap. I could have printed one of the countless useful things
on <a href="https://www.youmagine.com" target="_blank"> Youmagine </a> , <a href="https://cubehero.com" target="_blank"> Cubehero
</a> or <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com" target="_blank"> Thingiverse.com </a> ,
but I wanted to include the design step in my experiment to accurately measure
the end-to-end (or mind-to-matter, if you will) process.</p>
<p>There’s certainly faster ways to produce larger amounts of buttons, but all-
told I don’t think I could have acquired a single button like this faster if I
had purchased one (travel time, etc.), and it’s very unlikely I could have
done it less expensively.</p>
