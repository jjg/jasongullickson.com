Last weekend we visited [ Nitschke Mounds park
](https://www.co.dodge.wi.gov/departments/departments-e-m/land-resources-and-
parks/parks-and-trails/nitschke-mounds-park) which has a number of interesting
features but the one I have the most questions about is the **spring-fed
pond** .

The pond was open (not frozen) and there appears to be living algae or some
other sort of aquatic plants, both somewhat uncommon for a small pond during
the winter in Wisconsin.

  

There also is a residue on the rocks that perhaps indicates salts or other
minerals in the water?

I’ve been trying to find out what is known about the chemistry of the pond but
so far I haven’t had much luck. If you know more about this place please get
in touch.
