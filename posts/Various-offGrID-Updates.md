<p>A <a href="http://n-o-d-e.net/" target="_blank"> friend </a> asked me how <a href="https://github.com/jjg/offgrid" target="_blank"> OffGRiD
</a> is coming along; here’s where things are at:</p>
<p>I’ve designed a lot of the case and started printing off some parts to see how
they fit together and get a feel for the real-world size of the thing.</p>
<p><img alt="assembly_only.png" src="/preposterous/assets/71-assembly_only.png"/></p>
<p>I’m pretty happy with the way things fit and I’m honestly surprised that
things matched-up when I laid them out together with placeholders for the off-
the-shelf parts.</p>
<p>At this point I think I’m running out of things I can do without getting my
hands on the components, especially the solar panel and display.  I’ve been
working from the manufacturer’s specs, but they don’t tell me everything I
need (or are completely missing for some of the parts).  It’s also hard for me
to really get a feel for the stuff without having it on-hand, and stuff like
cable routing, etc. is hard (at least for me) to model in CAD.</p>
<p>The big barrier to getting the parts is the cost.  All-in it’s about $500.00
in components and I’d like to have some spares/alternatives just in case.  I’m
considering doing a little crowfunding campaign to raise some R&amp;D funds but I
don’t want to get distracted from the project itself to run the campaign, so
I’m still looking for alternatives.</p>
<p>Longer-term something I’ve been noodling on is a way to help people who are
interested in a computer like OffGRiD get their hands on one.  I don’t want to
get into mass-producing them (it goes against some of the design goals to do
so) but I did think of a way to make it more accessible for a broader range of
people.</p>
<p>Once I have a working prototype or two, I’m thinking about creating a website
where you can build-our your own personalized OffGRiD-style computer by
selecting the off-the-shelf components (display, processor, battery, etc.) and
have the site generate a Bill of Materials (BOM) for the off-the-shelf parts
and then a collection of custom printable files for the case, keyboard, etc.</p>
<p>From there you can download the BOM &amp; printables and source them yourself, or
place an order for the components directly on the website (sourced from
companies we like to support) and also send the printable files to a 3D
printing company like 3D Hubs, Shapeways, etc.</p>
<p>This leaves assembly to the user, which is OK but I’d also like to partner
with regional maker/hackerspaces so a person has options on finding local
help, or setting up “build nights”, etc.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly ambitious project in it’s own right, but I don’t think too much
so.  It’s something I don’t want to dive into until I know that I can actually
design a machine that works (and is pleasant to work with) so the prototypes
come first, but I think it’s good to have an idea of what’s next for a
project, especially one that requires a substantial up-front investment in
time &amp; resources.</p>
