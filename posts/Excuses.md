<div class="content">
<p>Yeah, I know, I promised you all a new toy this week, however due to
circumstances beyond my control (ie, launching another new website), I’ve been
unable to deliver this week’s toy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you could consider the new site this weeks toy, in that
case, I’ve more than delivered (not that I can take all the credit/blame for
this one).</p>
<p>I guess either way, I’m slackin’, but don’t let this discorage you, dear
reader, I will return next week with a new toy, and it will be worth the wait,
i promise ; )</p>
<p>In the meantime, heres a new poll to keep you busy…</p>
