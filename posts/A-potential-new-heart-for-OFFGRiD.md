<p>As I’ve mentioned I’ve been playing with the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/Mixtile/mixtile-gena/" target="_blank"> Mixtile GENA
</a> , a neat little
device that’s a lot like the heart of a Pebble watch.  They’ve been enjoying
my work with the device and have offered to send me another one of their
products to experiment, the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/Mixtile
/mixtile-loft-q/" target="_blank"> LOFT-Q </a> .</p>
<p>I hadn’t heard of the LOFT-Q before but checking it out, it looks like
potential candidate for the brains of <a href="http://wiki.2soc.net/doku.php?id=offgrid" target="_blank"> OFFGRiD
</a> .  There’s a bit more to it in
terms of size and cost than the other SBC’s I’ve been considering, but it
packs a lot of things in that I’d like to have inside the OFFGRiD.</p>
<p>The question will be whether or not it can operate in the constraints I’ve
imposed on the laptop, in particular the physical size and power consumption.
On the other hand there is a possibility that it might allow me to eliminate
some of the hardware I’d otherwise need for the other SBC’s I’ve been
considering, and that would be a big win.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something a bit beefier than a Raspberry Pi or and
Odroid the LOFT-Q is worth a look.  I can’t vouch for it’s quality yet, but if
it’s anything like the GENA I’m sure it will be well made.</p>
