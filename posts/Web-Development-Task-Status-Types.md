<div class="content">
<p>I’m working up a list of status types for the tasks of a web app project.
I’ve seen so many variations on this but they seem to be either too vague or
too numerous.</p>
<p>I decided to write out what I felt mattered when I was on the receiving end of
such a list and here’s what I came up with:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>There’s nothing there</p></li>
<li><p>There’s something there</p></li>
<li><p>It works</p></li>
<li><p>It looks good</p></li>
<li><p>It’s ready for testing</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’m happy with the meaning here, but it’s a bit unprofessional.  If you can
suggest a replacement for one of these that I like, I’ll send you a coupon
code for a free copy of one of my iOS applications (just look under “Products”
on <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/" target="_blank"> http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/
</a> ).</p>
