<p>DONOR-1 will be spending the snowy months cozily entertaining customers (and hopefully not annoying employees too much) at the <a href="http://hfhrestore.org/" target="_blank">Beaver Dam Habitat for Humanity ReStore</a>. <img alt="25152296_814543168728040_6782820194895214702_n" src="/wp/2017/12/25152296_814543168728040_6782820194895214702_n.jpg"/> DONOR-1 arrived at the ReStore last week (during the first significant snowfall) but unfortunately decided to act-up.  After bringing the control panel back to the laboratory, it turned out the monitor had reset itself to factory settings and was going into power-save mode after 15 minutes or so. <img alt="" src="/wp/2017/12/img_1900.jpg"/> After a little debugging and a lot of testing, the panel was reassembled and returned to the rest of the cabinet.  After a quick game of Time Pilot the field testing was complete and DONOR-1 was ready for business. If you are in the area be sure to stop in, drop a few quarters and check out the store! Funds collected by DONOR-1 will be donated to Habitat for Humanity to support their mission of providing shelter and self-reliance (as well as the side-effect of operating an excellent place to get parts for projects!).</p>
