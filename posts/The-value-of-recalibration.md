title: "The value of recalibration"

<div class="content">
<p>Today was a lot of trying and failing.  Among other things, I really wanted to
print some things on the Reprap but each time it went wrong and the whole
thing was very gumption depleting.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard to realize that the machine was out of adjustment, and no
amount of luck or perseverance was going to change that.  But I “just wanted
it to work”, and I didn’t want to be bothered with calibrating it, so I just
got frustrated and turned to working on something else (there’s always
something else to work on after all).</p>
<p>A few hours later Jamie made some really cool crafts and shared them with me.
Seeing them, and seeing the work that went into them, I suddenly had the
motivation to make the printer work again, and I was even excited about the
process of recalibrating it.</p>
<p>I think it’s easy to get frustrated when focus on an end goal creates an
illusion that the steps between where you are and where you want to be are
unimportant or nonexistent.  To think that the goal even exists without the
steps leading to it is absurd if you think about it, but it’s easy to loose
sight of this in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>Even though reigning from a pursuit can feel like failure or giving up, often
this is one of these invisible steps, and in my case a necessary one to put me
on the path to mustering the ambition necessary to complete the entire course.</p>
