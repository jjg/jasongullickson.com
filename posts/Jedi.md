<p>Jedi is the first application developed specifically to run on jsfs.  By
beginning with an editor, it’s possible to bootstrap the developent of any
other application and develop them from within jsfs itself.  There is a lot
more to do, obviously, but this is a significant development, and a major step
toward making jsfs behave like a true general-purpose computing platform.</p>
<p>Jedi source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/jjg/jedi" target="_blank"> Github </a> now,
future versions will be available directly via jsfs.</p>
