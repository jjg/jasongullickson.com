<p>I knew the only way I’d be sure to continue to improve <a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposterous" target="_blank"> Preposterous
</a> was if I was forced to use it
regularly, so I decided that on January 1st, 2014 I would switch Gullickson
Laboratories from Wordpress to <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/thoughts-on-preposterous-2-0.html" target="_blank"> Preposterous 2.0
</a> .</p>
<p>Of course <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/thoughts-
on-preposterous-2-0.html" target="_blank"> Preposterous 2.0 </a> isn’t ready yet, but I didn’t let that minor detail
stop me from meeting my arbitrary goal of switching over the site.  I had also
hoped to have something in place to handle incoming links to pages that no
longer exist, but you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, right?</p>
<p>So, things are going to be a bit of a mess around here for awhile but what
better motivation could I have to make Preposterous better than making my own
blog count on it, right?  Over the next few weeks I’ll be bringing over the
most popular posts from the old site but I didn’t want to simply <em>import</em>
them…</p>
<p>Instead, I want to take time to “curate” the old posts.  Some will simply be
re-posted as originally written but others will be annotated to provide
context and framing so they can be seen in the light of their time (remember
some of those posts go back to 2000, and some things have changed since then).
Others, especially those that relate to specific technology may be updated so
they can be useful with current versions of software, etc.</p>
<p>In addition I’ll continue to pursue the remaining work outlined for <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/thoughts-on-
preposterous-2-0.html" target="_blank">
Preposterous 2.0 </a> and beyond, with this blog being the key source of
information about updates, releases and other information about the project.</p>
<p>Thank-you for your patience during this transition, it’s not the first, and it
certainly won’t be the last.</p>
