<div class="content">
<p>I found out something surprising today: there’s no copyright protection for
raw data.  Here’s my source:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-
copy-raw-data-from-a-protected-database.html" target="_blank"> http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/can-you-copy-raw-data-from-a
-protected-database.html </a></p>
<p>Now of course this is one source, and like most things involving U.S. law,
it’s debatable, but the fact that there is precedent to support the fact adds
some weight to the argument.</p>
<p>If this is true it opens up some interesting areas of discussion around Big
Data.  One of the key tenants to most big data architectures is a focus on
capturing “raw data”, data that hasn’t been selected, coordinated or arranged.
The idea behind this is that it allows you to defer decision-making about what
data you need and what data you don’t.  By capturing all the data raw, you
have everything available to you if at a later time you want to extract
something unexpected, or correlate the data a new way.</p>
<p>However, in light of the legal explanation above, this means that companies
who are operating Big Data initiatives are currently amassing large pools of
data for which traditional legal protections do not apply.  This data is
currently bought-and-sold for-profit among many different companies and
agencies; I wonder if they understand that they don’t own it?</p>
<p>The barrier, of course is access.  While you and I might be able to use say,
Target’s customer database without violating copyright, we would first need
(legal) access to it.  This seems like a pretty secure barrier, but maybe
there’s a loophole.  If such a loophole exists, the investment these companies
have made in collecting and managing this raw data may not provide the return
they expect.</p>
