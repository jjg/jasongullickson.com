<div class="content">
<p>About two years ago I put together a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eg2YgIuBx-
gVpKT1hB3_rL_OwfpoevLcFBpKYiJqY7Q/edit?usp=sharing&amp;authkey=CNSdqu8P" target="_blank"> proposal for a solution
</a> to the
array of problems facing the domestic robot.  You know the kind, the robotic
maid that was part of “ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland" target="_blank"> Tomorrowland
</a> “ in the 1960’s (hence the
project name “ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000696/" target="_blank"> Rosie </a> “) and
“just around the corner” in the 1980’s but instead the best we could manage
what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roomba" target="_blank"> Roomba </a> .</p>
<p>There’s a number of reasons we never got our robot butlers.  Over time some of
these have been addressed by dramatic improvements in technology and the
reduced cost of components.  In other areas however there has been little
applicable progress; machine vision, artificial intelligence and dynamic
feedback control systems (responding to changing conditions, etc.), all of
these areas have improved since the 1980’s but not enough to make building a
domestic robot practical, and even with an unlimited budget, such a machine
would have limitations that would disappoint.</p>
<p>What has improved dramatically since the 80’s though is communication
networks, and in many ways these networks have made it possible for people to
work together around the world, regardless of physical location and to some
degree, without the encumbrances of social-political borders or economic
limitations.  These networks allow work to be distributed globally, from
programmers to telemarketers to drive-through attendants.</p>
<p>However for the most part taking advantage of the ability to work globally has
been limited to work that can be transmitted electronically (there are a few
exceptions).  Wouldn’t it be cool if people who work in the physical world
could enjoy the same power and convenience that telecommuters have enjoyed for
decades?</p>
<p>This is where Rosie comes in.  Initially replacing the role of the household
cleaning service, Rosie is a telepresence robot that combines the mechanical
and electrical advances in robotics with the availability of high-speed
communications networks to provide the safety and convenience of a domestic
robot with the control and intellect currently only available via a human
operator.</p>
<p>By abstracting physical presence from the housekeeping work, Rosie provides
increased value to the housekeeper in the form of reduced cost, scalability,
increased safety and tangental educational benefits as well.</p>
<p>For the housekeeping customer, Rosie increases convenience, reduces cost-per-
utility and allows for greater control and management of the service with
lower personal overhead.</p>
<p>Additionally, Rosie provides housekeeping professionals with training and
experience beyond the work at hand, creating a growing number of experienced
professional operators who’s skills could be transitioned to maintaining and
operating robots for more diverse applications.</p>
<p>The nature of housekeeping work strikes a nice balance between providing a
challenging engineering task for the design of the robot while at the same
time remaining simple and focused enough that designing and implementing such
a machine is within the means of current technology and within reach of a
small team with a relatively short development timeline (1-2 years).</p>
<p>The up-front and operational cost of such a robot is such that it could employ
a mobile-phone-style pricing structure, baking the unit price into a fixed
contract resulting in a monthly cost that is equivalent to a traditional
housekeeping service but with the potential to provide better service.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this pricing structure is that off-contract robots become the
property of the housekeeping customer, allowing them to be sold off-contract
and potentially applied to additional uses, which leads to “phase two” of this
project.</p>
<p>By underwriting the development of a basic but functional telepresence
chassis, the Rosie product funds the development of more sophisticated
machines that can then be dispatched for more challenging tasks.  Evolution of
the design is part of this proposal, and within a year or two of rolling out
the housekeeping models, new models designed for other jobs will become
available.  It’s not hard to imagine other areas of work that would benefit
from decoupling the work from a human operator, allowing for more flexible
scheduling (since workers could be available from other parts of the world),
reductions in safety-related costs (specialized machines can accommodate work
that is unsafe or uncomfortable for on-location humans).</p>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that manual-labor is not the only application for
such robots, that any profession which  currently requires (or benefits from)
physical presence could be improved by specialized telepresence robots or by
the availability of general-purpose robots that could be dispatched around the
world quickly and conveniently (it’s not hard to imagine offices or factories
maintaining a collection of such machines the way that they currently maintain
other office equipment, allowing instant on-site visits from employees from
other locations).</p>
<p>Rosie (and descendants) can operate anywhere that can be reached by the
control network, and without the life-support requirements of living workers,
this includes extra-terrestrial operations.</p>
<p>In the years since I first proposed Rosie, interest in telepresence has been
on the rise.  Several companies have introduced <a href="http://www.doublerobotics.com" target="_blank"> telepresence products
</a> at increasingly accessible price-points,
evidence that a market is emerging for these machines.  However, the machines
currently available seem to be an evolution of telecommunication devices and
lack the ability to interact with their environment beyond sight and sound.
For these reasons I believe that Rosie is now a viable product and that
investment in such an effort now will lead a generation of such robots, laying
the foundation for future machines with more automatic, autonomous
capabilities, and I would be happy to lend my experience to such a project.</p>
