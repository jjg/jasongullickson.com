<p>Over a year ago I started building a RepRap.  During that time I’d say it was
operational for about four months; the rest of the time was spent
troubleshooting, learning, waiting on parts and fixing things (mostly the hot-
end).</p>
<p>In the last two weeks things have accelerated tremendously.  The key to this
success was replacing the Makergear hot-end that came with my kit with a
J-Head; after that things started to come together.</p>

where we left off before the “headaches”</p>
<p>Once I was able to print for more than a couple minutes I stared to find other
areas to improve, and this is where the RepRap really comes into it’s zone,
because the RepRap is born to be hacked.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of modifications I’ve made so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Added these thumbwheels to make leveling the bed easier (possible?): <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39459" target="_blank"> http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39459 </a></p></li>
<li><p>This fan mount: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13343" target="_blank"> http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13343 </a></p></li>
<li><p>These z-rod isolators to eliminate “ripples” (more on this later): <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20147" target="_blank"> http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:20147 </a></p></li>
<li><p>A better z-stop adjuster (attempted twice but still failed to print): <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25383" target="_blank"> http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25383 </a></p></li>
<li><p>An even better fan (the other mount doesn’t seem to actually get the air where it needs to go): <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34387" target="_blank"> http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34387 </a></p></li>
<li><p>Another thing to address z-rod wobble: <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34140" target="_blank"> http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34140 </a></p></li>
</ul>

thumbwheel to make leveling the bed possible…</p>
<p>I’m still working on addressing the z-wobble.  My prints are starting to turn
out pretty good but I’m still getting a rib pattern on the walls that seems to
come from a bend in the threaded rod that raises and lowers the nozzle.  The
first thing I printed seem to make this better, but it was still present so
I’m trying something more drastic and replacing the threaded rod in the z-axis
alltogether.  We’ll see how that goes but I may end up going all the way to a
proper set of leadscrews to fix it once and for all.</p>

but…still a bit wavy on the sides</p>
<p>I’m also troubleshooting a problem printing circular overhangs, they tend to
get ahead of the nozzle and from the discussions I’ve had this has to do with
laying a new layer down while the previous layer is still cooling.  I’ve
printed an improved fan mount/duct that is supposed to help with this but I’m
also going to try and slow down a bit while printing shapes like this to see
if it improves.</p>

…one fan duct to rule them all!</p>
<p>This might sound like a bunch of problems but really it’s been a blast to work
on.  The cool thing about the RepRap is that the more you are willing to do
the better it gets; the printer is capable of producing useful parts as-is
(otherwise it couldn’t improve itself) so I could just stop and use it (and to
some degree I have), but I love to hack and this device, more than anything I
can remember working on provides such an awesome reward for someone interested
in putting in the extra work.</p>

<em>all</em> of the prints are serious engineering improvements</p>
<p>I have an album on Google+ where I’m collecting all of my RepRap related
photos if you’d like to follow along the adventure visually: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/103331171897037694195/albums/5822923079196979745" target="_blank"> RepRap Album
