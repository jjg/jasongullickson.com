<p>There’s something very exciting about the idea of developing software geared
toward professional use only.  Professionals are willing to invest in tools
that provide value (it’s simple math) and they are willing to learn to use a
tool if doing so will make it more valuable.</p>
<p>The idea of being able to pick up a piece of software and start using it, with
no experience, makes sense for casual users but if you’re going to be living
inside a piece of software it should be optimized for that kind of use, not
optimized to make it easy for anyone to use.</p>
<p>There used to be a lot of software like this, but even territories like film
editing and CAD have mostly fallen to the “intuitive” school.  Don’t get me
wrong, I think that approachable, novice-intuitive tools should exist (not
everyone is a professional at everything) but I don’t think that they should
exist at the cost of expert tools.</p>
<p>Unix is another kind of protool.  A little effort in learning the essential
concepts of Unix (commands, arguments, pipes, etc.) can provide serious
empowerment, but there is essentially zero way to “discover” this on your own
(without reading the docs or something).</p>
<p>I’d like to consider the “protools” perspective as I develop new projects.
Not so much that I need to target existing professional audiences, but the
idea that it’s OK to build something that isn’t right for everyone, or
requires a little learning to be able to use effectively.  I think the result
will be less up-front design time wasted and a greater level of user
satisfaction, even if it’s for a smaller number of users.</p>
<p>I think there’s already enough things in the world that are trying to be right
for everyone, and by that nature, perfect for no one.</p>
