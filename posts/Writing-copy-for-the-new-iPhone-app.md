<p>Usually this is my least favorite part of the process but for the first time I
have something that doesn’t require specialized knowledge or boutique
interests to understand.</p>
<p>I shipped the first draft of my iTunes store copy off to my beta testers for
feedback so we’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>I’m getting excited about submitting this one and hopefully I’m not
overlooking some “hey there’s no crashed car in the intersection”-sort of
problem. I’m totally anticipating approval problems only because I’ve been
hearing about more of them lately and I’ve even had a small taste of that
process myself with a previous app.</p>
<p>But for the moment all is well, it’s been almost 24 hours since I posted RC1
and I’ve yet to receive a new bug report. I noticed one item that I’d like to
address but it’s by no means a showstopper. If we make it through the next 24
w/o incident, I plan on damning the torpedos and submitting the app…</p>
<p>…unless I get this one last thing in…</p>
