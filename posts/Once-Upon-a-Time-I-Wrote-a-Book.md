<div class="content">
<p>A while back I wrote a book; well… <em>most</em> of a book.</p>
<p>It started with a Tweet from a publisher, re-tweeted by a friend, that showed
up in my feed.  The publisher was looking for authors interested in writing
technology books for kids.  I had been considering writing a tech book for
years, even started a few, and I had recently posted a detailed blog post on
how to 3D print objects created in Minecraft, so I thought I’d reach out and
give it a shot.</p>
<p>I had a great conversation with the publisher on Twitter, which turned into an
email conversation and eventually I was taking the next step and submitting a
proposed table of contents for the book.  The original title was “3D Printing
with Minecraft”, and I designed the chapters around the idea of teaching the
basics of 3D printing through exercises that could be carried-out using
Minecraft.  The approximate page-count came out to about 100 pages, and I felt
like it was something I could do well, essentially expanding on my original
blog post.  The book would be structured like my favorite electronics book,
Forrest M. Mimm’s “ <a href="http://amzn.to/2bXWscq" target="_blank"> Getting Started in Electronics </a>
“ with the first part covering theory, and the second part containing a
collection of exercises.</p>
<p>The publisher thought this was OK but they were looking for something more
substantial, so we went through a process of notes and re-working the TOC.
The end result was something more like 200-300 pages and was a lot more like a
typical tech book.  It was now evolving into the eventual title “3D Printing
with Reprap”, and the audience was no longer kids but beginners in general.</p>
<p>At this point I probably should have stopped.  The book was no longer the book
I wanted to write, and there were other constraints that came up which I
wasn’t comfortable with and I knew would slow down my work, but this is the
first time I’d written a “real book”, and so I trusted the professionals and
pressed-on.</p>
<p>There was also the money.  I was promised an “advance” that I thought I could
put toward parts  &amp; equipment I’d need for the exercises part of the book.  To
me this was the big difference between writing the book on my own and working
with a publisher, I wouldn’t have to carry the financial weight of getting it
done alone.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I talked myself into continuing and began submitting chapters to
my editor.  This was when I realized another benefit of working with a
publisher: someone else would be editing my work!  I could focus on putting
words and pictures on the page and someone else would make sure that my output
would compile-down into proper English.  This elation didn’t last long
however, because the feedback I received resulted in more than simple grammar
and formatting notes and ultimately, changed the book radically.</p>
<p>The overall push of the editors notes was to make the book integrate exercises
with theory, again making it more like a typical tech book.  Additionally
there was a push to use different art, to move away from the hand-drawn style
I had  included (created by Jamie) and replacing it with primitive 3D models
and screenshots, something like what you might see in “Windows XP for
Dummies”.  Again this felt wrong, but  I reminded myself “they are the
professionals”, and anyway, one more chapter and I should reach the threshold
to receive part of my advance, and I can focus on the fun part of building &amp;
writing the example projects.</p>
<p>So I furiously typed away, pushing through OpenOffice crashes (did I mention I
was forced to use OpenOffice?), ripping apart chapters and re-structuring,
including the new art and emailing changes to the editor.  After turning in
more chapters than my contract defined as necessary to begin receiving the
advance, I didn’t hear anything about it, so I asked.  The response was that
they chapters didn’t count until they were <em>accepted</em> , at which point I’d
start to receive the advance.</p>
<p>At this point I started hearing less and less from my editor, and responses
that came took longer and longer.  Excuses were made and to fill the gaps I
started working on later chapters until the book was almost complete.
Eventually a month passed between submitting my latest edits and receiving a
response, so I decided to reach-out to the editor and see what was going on.</p>
<p>I never found out exactly what was going on, but I received a long apology and
was informed that the editor was being taken off my project.  In her place the
publisher would take over and delegate where necessary to a team of editors so
we could get the project back on track.  I was excited about this, I was
starting to think that things were falling apart because of me, the quality of
my work or lack of experience.  It was a relief to know that things felt wrong
because something <em>was</em> going wrong, and now it was going to  be made right.</p>
<p>The publisher reviewed the work so far and a week or so later responded with
an email that left me aghast.  Long story short, he wanted to throw out
everything that had been done up to this point and suggested a new structure,
<em>which happened to be just like my original one</em> .  In a nutshell, everything
that the editor had made me change since the beginning of the project took the
book down the wrong path, and we essentially wasted a year and countless hours
doing what I felt was wrong.  I tried to explain to the publisher that I had
pushed against these changes, but it basically fell on deaf ears, and at this
point it became less about fixing what the editor had done wrong and more
about how I was providing unusable content, and would essentially have to
start over.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this also meant that I’d be going back to square-one in terms
of receiving any advance.  Bear in mind that this is over a year after the
start of the project, and I’ve made significant personal sacrifices in terms
of time and money to work on the book, and I’ve yet to see a dime of
consideration from the publisher.  This was also around the time that Jamie
received a cancer diagnosis, and I had been hoping that I could recover some
of the money I had put into the book project to help cover medical expenses.</p>
<p>I made a valiant attempt to re-work the first chapters to meet the
requirements of the new structure and hit the mark to receive part of the
advance.  I went around-and-around with the publisher-editor who changed his
mind about the direction of the chapter (or entire book) each time I submitted
an edit.  This, coupled with endless technical difficulties exchanging
documents resulted in another few months passing by with no end in sight.</p>
<p>I was still hopeful that we could complete the project successfully, in a way
that would benefit everyone involved, but the external pressures on me reached
a point where I needed some support from the publisher to continue.  I wrote a
heartfelt email to the publisher explaining all the details of my personal
situation, and a explanation from my perspective about how we reached this
point, and requested the initial payment of the advance.  What I received back
could be summed-up as:</p>
<p><em>That sucks, but your book is now a mess, and I can’t tell you when we’ll be
ready to compensate you.</em></p>
<p>At this point I walked away from the project for awhile and thought about my
options.  In filmmaking (in particular, editing), I’d been introduced to the
term “kill your darlings”.  The idea is that you can fall in love with work
you’ve done on the film, that will make it harder for you throw them out
during the edit, even if you should to make the entire film better.  This was
probably one of those times, and I probably should have burned then entire
book and chalked it up to experience, but it was too hard, I had sunk so much
time and thought and care into the project I couldn’t bring myself to walk
away.  I was also too optimistic, and I had a mission in mind for this book,
to turn newcomers to 3D printing on to the <a href="http://reprap.org/" target="_blank"> Reprap project
</a> , and I thought this was too important to throw away.</p>
<p>The one upside of having received zero compensation from the publisher is that
it makes a good case for our contract being invalid.  Armed with this, I
decided to go it alone, request cancellation of my contract and publish the
book on my own.  I wrote an email to the publisher explaining the situation,
and received a gruff and curt response, including a signed letter ending our
contract.</p>
<p>I converted the entire contents of the book to Markdown for publishing via <a href="https://leanpub.com/3dprintingandreprap" target="_blank">
LeanPub </a> .  I roped Jamie into
editing the book, and we started working on turning into something worth
reading.  This continued for awhile, but it became apparent that much of the
content would have to be re-done because it was written two years ago, and so
much had changed in 3D printing, it was no longer relevant.  I believe I made
a valiant effort at this, but combined with everything else happening around
me, it became intractable.</p>
<p>That brings us to today.  It’s been several months since I committed any
changes to the book, and every day the relevancy of the existing content
rusts.  What I’ve learned from the process is indispensable, but the body of
work is probably less so.  In the off-chance that it is of any value to
others, I have made the repository containing the manuscript public, and I’m
happy to accept pull requests.</p>

<p>I have also published the book in its current state and made it available for
free on LeanPub.  You can find and download the current version here:</p>

<p>My advice to other authors-to-be is, if it’s at all possible to publish your
book without a publisher, do so.  If you are writing a book that requires
capital up-front to pay for research, equipment, ramen noodles, etc., make
sure any publisher you engage with intends to pay you up-front.  We have so
many alternatives to the traditional publishing industry that it would be a
shame to ignore them, and I hope if nothing else this post helps aspiring
authors avoid experiencing what I have, and they are able to share their work
with the world.</p>
