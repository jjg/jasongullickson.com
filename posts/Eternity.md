<p>Something I think about often is how to make information available forever.</p>
<p>A good example of my struggles with this is my blog.  I know there’s stuff
I’ve posted over the last decade or two that might be of use to others, but
even keeping that published over that relatively short amount of time has been
challenging (as you can see here).</p>
