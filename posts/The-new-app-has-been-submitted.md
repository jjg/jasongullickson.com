<p>After Apple’s announcement today that iPhone OS 3.0 will be available 06/17, I
decided to skip the 2.2 version and release the 3.0 features immediately.</p>
<p>So, tonight I re-enabled the 3.0 features, gathered the various media and bits
required for submission and sent the app up.</p>
<p>I imagine they are swamped, more than usual, so I don’t expect to hear
anything anytime soon, but with any luck we’ll be one of the first “build for
iPhone 3.0” apps in the store…</p>
<p>…wish me luck!</p>
