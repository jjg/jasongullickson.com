<p>A couple weeks ago I started noticing some black goo on some of my prints.
Within a few days I found the cause, the resistor that provides the heat for
my J-Head had gone critical and melted down.</p>
<p>I did a little reading on this and I have a few ideas on ways to improve on
the design to avoid this in the future, but I’ve had such luck with the
standard setup I ordered a replacement so I could get back to printing and
then experiment with the old head on the side.</p>

<p>One thing I’m doing different with the replacement is using “muffler putty”
instead of aluminum foil to ensure a tight fit between the resistor and the
body of the nozzle, since failure at this interface can lead to premature
resistor death and may have played a role in the failure of my last nozzle.</p>

<p>I wasn’t exactly sure what kind of putty to get, so I went with Blue Magic’s
“QuickSteel” since it had the highest temperature limit of the options I had
available (the others topped out a little too close to ABS temperatures for my
taste).</p>
<p>I’m somewhat concerned about what it might take to remove a resistor secured
in this fashion when it eventually fails, but I guess that’s what drills and
Dremel’s are for right?</p>
