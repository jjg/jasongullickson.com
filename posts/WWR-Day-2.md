<div class="content">
<p>Today was tougher, my daughter insisted on playing a song for me and I tried
to convince her to sing it instead( unsuccessfully).</p>
<p>Also Professor Elemental released a new video for his song “Splendid” today as
well, which I had to abstain from.</p>
<p>I expect tomorrow to be even more difficult as I return to work and will have
to spend some time coding with only the soothing sounds of the computer fans.</p>
<p>Talk to you tomorrow.</p>
