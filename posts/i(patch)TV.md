<p>For me one of the biggest problems with <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/171494/apple_app_store_needs_reality_check.html" target="_blank"> Apple’s iPhone App approval process
</a>
is that, in order to cope with my impatience, I have to find ways to distract
myself.</p>
<p>This time around it’s awoken my continual desire to operate my own TV station.</p>
<p>I’ve had this dream for a long time.  The earliest inklings I can remember
involve converting an abandoned TV repair shop into a studio and taping shows
using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PXL-2000" target="_blank"> PXL-2000 </a> camcorders.  Since
then the idea has stirred in my mind repeatedly, ever two years or so and each
time it comes a little closer to fruition.</p>
<p>In this day and age you might wonder why I wouldn’t turn this ambition to
producing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast" target="_blank"> video podcast </a> or some
other sort of “ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webisode" target="_blank"> webisode </a> “-based
entertainment but while that make so much more sense, it lacks the romance of
beaming your productions out into the world where they can be enjoyed by
anyone with a simple, lowly television set in the comfort of their living
room.</p>
<p>Before tonight, the last time the idea occurred to me was when the “official”
date was set for the end of analog tv broadcast (the original date).  I
thought it would be awesome to have an analog station up-and-running the day
after the cut-off, on some popular broadcast channel, so that unsuspecting
viewers who didn’t figure out the switch-over would just continue watching
analog tv, but with my station on the other end.</p>
<p>Apparently I wasn’t the <a href="http://omgimon.tv/drupal/" target="_blank"> only one </a> with this
idea.</p>
<p>So tonight as I’m catching up on my <a href="http://hackaday.com/" target="_blank"> Hack A Day </a> RSS
feed I come across a <a href="http://hackaday.com/2009/09/02
/build-an-analog-tv-station/" target="_blank"> collection of articles </a> about setting up your own tv station and since I
haven’t heard back from Apple about <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/shufflito" target="_blank"> Shufflito
</a> , I’m more inclined to dig
into the tv station dream than to work through the new features I have planned
for Shufflito 1.1.  Whether or not this will amount to any action is really up
to Apple, since a three-day-weekend lies ahead and if I don’t hear something
that redirects my attention I may just be strapping a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yagi_antenna" target="_blank"> yagi
</a> to the new treehouse…</p>
<p>…and if I do, I’ll be sure to post the frequency, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tager" target="_blank"> Kenneth
