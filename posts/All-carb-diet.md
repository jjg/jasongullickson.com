<p>I spent some quality time with the carbs in the basement tonight.</p>
<p>At first I was a bit worried to see that there were more parts in the “carb
kits” that I bought than I could find a place for in my carburetors, however
consulting my handy service manual indicated that my CL came with two
different types of carb, and these extra pieces were for the “other” kind.</p>
<p>Other than that things went very smoothly and I had both carbs back together
in about 90 minutes. I still need to adjust them (as much as you can before
mounting them) but I was just happy to have all the pieces together that I
called it a night.</p>
<p>I’m working on a longer post to outline everything I have planned for the bike
at this point, I’ll post it soon once I’ve updated the list.</p>
<p>Progress!</p>
<p>(BTW, I took a few pictures but my damn VQ1000 threw an error and I wasn’t
able to pull them off the camera…I think I’m going back to film…)</p>
