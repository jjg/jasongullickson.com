<p>I’ve found that my writing has suffered since switching to Hugo.  I spent a lot of time reflecting on this, and realized that the most productive tool for me was one of my own design, <a href="https://codeberg.org/jjg/preposter.us" target="_blank">Preposter.us</a>.</p>
<p>That being the case I’ve resumed work on that project, and revived the domain as well.  All future posts will be made to my Preposter.us blog, located at:</p>
<p><a href="https://preposter.us/single-michigan-helium-network/" target="_blank">https://preposter.us/single-michigan-helium-network/</a></p>
<p>Eventually that blog will reside here, at <a href="https://jasongullickson.com/" target="_blank">jasongullickson.com</a>, but there is work yet to do around using custom domains with Preposter.us and I don’t want that work to impede the writing, so I’m just going to leave this little breadcrumb here for now.</p>
<p>I’m also going to need to find a reasonable way to host <a href="https://jasongullickson.com/about/" target="_blank">the archive</a> of posts that currently live here.  I have a few ideas but that another thing I’ll need to figure out before redirecting this domain name.</p>
<p>Looking forward to getting back in the groove, catch you on the flip-side!</p>
