<div class="content">
<p>I’m going to be migrating some of my favorite posts from my original <a href="http://preposter.us/oregon-king-uranus-autumn/" target="_blank">
Preposter.us blog </a> to this
one over the next year.  Along the way I plan to update them as I see fit, so
consider them the “second edition” if you will.</p>
<p>I’m doing this because I want to make sure this information remains public,
but importing them in a way that reflects their original chronology is
complicated due to the email-based nature of <a href="http://preposter.us/" target="_blank"> Preposter.us
</a> .  At first I was frustrated by this, but upon
reflection I think the end result will be of higher quality, and I’m less
concerned with establishing the strict age of these post than I am about
simply making them easily available to myself and others.</p>
