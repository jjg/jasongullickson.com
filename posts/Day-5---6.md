<p>It’s early in Day 6 but…</p>
<p>Yesterday I was very tempted to stray from the course.  I was talking with
some friends about <a href="http://jasongullickson.posterous.com/a-week-without-records" target="_blank"> Week Without Records
</a> and the more I
talked about what it meant the harder it was to maintain.</p>
<p>I’m trying to capture the ideas that arise through this exercise, it has given
me understanding about music and the music industry that I never had before,
but there’s so much, I’m having a hard time getting it all down in a
communicable way.</p>
<p>I should probably just focus on getting it down in any way possible and then
sort it out later.</p>
<p>In the meantime be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.space.com/12046-nasa-space-shuttle-final-flight-atlantis-
sts135.html" target="_blank"> final Space Shuttle launch
</a> , it’s scheduled for today but weather may delay it a bit.</p>
<p>Anxiously awaiting Sunday…</p>
