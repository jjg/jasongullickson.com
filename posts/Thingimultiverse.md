<p><em>This started as a long post to the G+ 3D Printing Group.  Here I attempt to
elaborate on that post by providing more details about architecture,
implementation and engaging an audience.</em></p>
<p>I think we’re getting to a point where a distributed, un-censorable object
repository system will become a necessity Thingiverse is great, but we’ve
already seen that they are willing to compromise content due to external
pressures.</p>
<p>I believe any single site, system or company is vulnerable to this sort of
pressure and furthermore I believe it is their right to choose what they host.</p>
<p>However, if history has taught us anything it is that allowing information to
be at the mercy of any level of tyranny can lead to loss of knowledge; due to
accidents, coincidence or in worse cases deliberate destruction.</p>
<p>What I propose as a remedy to this is a system of federating this information
instead of relying on any single entity, vulnerable to the systemic weaknesses
present in any type of organization known today. A federated system,
distributed across physical and political regions in order to avoid
constraints imposed by any type of external method of control or coercion.</p>
<p>At a less abstract level, this amounts to object repositories with
standardized access methods and standardized catalog data that can be easily
replicated to allow for indexing and searching across the entire federation of
repository sites.</p>
<p>The technology for this certainly exists (either in parts or perhaps in
whole), and I’m looking for feedback from this group to determine if perhaps
this work is already underway. I am aware that there are other sites like
Thingiverse out there, but at this point I’m unaware of any deliberate effort
to publish their content in a way that allows for global search across sites
(without relying on other centralized corporate entities like search engines)
or replication designs intended to distribute models across sites in an
automated fashion (necessary to prevent things from disappearing when a site
or object is taken down voluntarily or by force).</p>
<p>I believe now is the time to design these standards, while the proliferation
of “thing” repositories is small and the control mechanisms are still in their
infancy. If we wait too long, we’ll all become too attached to our personal
favorites and implementing a federated system will become more difficult.
Doing something now also makes it harder for those who would desire to curtail
such an effort if it has already demonstrated its value to a worldwide
community.</p>
<p>I’m planning to elaborate on these ideas and investigate implementation
options in the near future, so any information about simular or overlapping
projects you can share is appreciated.</p>
