<p>One Hour Cinema (OHC): write, shoot, edit and release a film in one hour or
less.</p>
<p>Around 2005 I started working in Milwaukee which was a change from Madison
where I had worked previously for over ten years.  I was writing software for
a living but I had a renewed interest in becoming a filmmaker.</p>
<p>With the extended commute and a young child at home the time I had to dedicate
to filmmaking was very limited, however I didn’t know anyone in Milwaukee so I
spent my lunch hours for the most part alone.  This is where One Hour Cinema
was born.</p>
<p>I was reading several books on filmmaking at the time but the one that stood
out was called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-
Filmmaking-Second-Russell-
Evans/dp/0240807383/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311168731&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank"> Practical DV Filmmaking </a> .  The book
provided a series of exercises which taught the skills necessary to produce a
film shot on digital video.  I didn’t have the time (or resources) to carry
out most of the exercises however I adapted the lessons to fit within the one
hour lunch break I had and used the equipment I had on-hand (a cheap digital
still camera and a laptop).</p>
<p>I did this for about a month and shot about one film per week.  This resulted
in three films (the fourth was not completed due to equipment failure),
“Neutron Man”, “The Old German Church” and “$1 Lunch”.  ”The Old German
Church” went on to be the first film that I screened in front of a public
audience.</p>
<p>The experience taught me how to be resourceful and recover from problems
quickly, as well as how to prioritize the work to meet a deadline.  While I
can’t say absolutely that this improves all artistic processes, for me it was
a way to move toward my goal of becoming a filmmaker and gain the necessary
skills within the time and equipment restrictions I had available to me.</p>
<p>From time to time I have considered producing another series of OHC films.
The capabilities of mobile devices such as the iPhone dramatically exceed the
tools I originally worked with in both image capture quality and editing
facilities (not to mention capacity and battery runtime), so the format may be
exceptionally well-suited for these devices.  In fact I am in the planning
process of teaching another filmmaking class and perhaps this will be part of
the curriculum.</p>
<p>If you make a OHC film please let me know, I’d love to see it!</p>
