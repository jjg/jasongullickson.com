<p>Back in the 1950’s and 60’s people said <em>“In the future, nobody will have to
work!”</em> now they complain <em>“In the future, there will be no jobs!”</em> .</p>
<p>I have a very simple solution to this: If you automate your job, you keep
getting paid for it. This would need to be a law, because obviously few
companies are going to comply voluntarily, but they should, and here’s why:</p>
<p>Robots don’t sue you for getting hurt/killed on the job. They rarely show up
drunk and get sick far less often than humans. They are massively more
productive and don’t complain about office chairs or lack of natural light.
They don’t form unions or demand health insurance. Long story short, it’s
still a net-gain to automate even if it doesn’t reduce salary expenses.</p>
<p>But it gets better. With this kind of motivation, workers won’t only welcome
automation, but they will help design it. Not only does this make the
transition less painful, it also means the results will be superior because
people who know the job will be working cooperatively to automate it. Hell,
some people might find out they like it so much they go on to another job and
repeat the process.</p>
<p>FWIW this is a normal mode of thought for programmers, going into a new task
and thinking about how you’re going to automate yourself out of it. Imagine if
the entire workforce approached problems this way, without fear that doing so
would result in financial ruin?</p>
<p>So in the long run we have more robots doing work while people continue to get
paid, and employers enjoy lower expenses and smarter workers. I know that win-
win scenarios are not fashionable, but I think if we were willing to give up
on our precious fear, it might just work.</p>
