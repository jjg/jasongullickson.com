<p>Last night we completed another key interview for the film and now we’re down
to only one left on the list. That isn’t to say we won’t be doing more, or
doing additional interviews of subjects we’ve already spoken with but what it
<em>does</em> mean is that we’re one interview away from putting together what we’re
calling the <em>“outline cut”</em> .</p>
<p>This is where we take everything we’ve shot so far, put it together in the
timeline and watch it end-to-end. The goal here is to see what we have,
identify the stories we want to focus on and determine what else we need to
tell these stories in a compelling way.</p>
<p>So it’s not so much the <strong>end</strong> of production in the traditional sense, but it
<em>is</em> the <strong>beginning</strong> of post-production and a milestone that we’ve really
been looking forward to. Unlike a drama, where the story is written <strong>before</strong>
the camera rolls, <strong>this</strong> is where the story our film will tell really starts
to emerge.</p>
<p>The other transition happening here is a shift in focus from working on the
motorcycle to one of working on the film. I have a few bike-related tasks in
store for the winter but the updates here will have more to do with <strong>“shots-
and-cuts”</strong> and less to do with <strong>“pipes-and-jets”</strong> (although bigger jets
<em>are</em> on the top of my parts list). The primary challenge facing the bike at
the moment is getting the title and license squared away and from my
experience that doesn’t make for very exciting writing. So unless something
particularly exciting happens, I’ll spare you the gory details.</p>
<p>We will also be annoucing new posts using our <a href="http://2soc.net/crudrundiaries/" target="_blank"> Slimey Mailing List
</a> . If you’d like to receive these updates, <a href="http://2soc.net/crudrundiaries/" target="_blank">

<p>Look forward to more consistent (if not more frequent) updates and let us know
if you like what you’re hearing or if there is something you think we’re
leaving out.</p>
