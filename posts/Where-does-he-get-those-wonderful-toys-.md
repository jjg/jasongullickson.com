<p>Here at jasongullickson.com we strive to provide you with sometimes useless,
but usually entertaining toys to kill some time with. In our relentless
attempt to give you something new each week, we present this weeks toy:</p>
<p>Hate Mail!</p>
<p>I’m not going to claim that the hate mail tool is anything I invented, and in
this version it resembles some other apps out on the net that do simular
things, however future versions will provide much neater (nastier?)
functionality. For now, drop in a message and take it for a spin, I will
hopefully adding to it’s “vocabulary” often, so come back and try it again for
even more hyjinx.</p>
<p>In addition to the new toy, I’d like to take this chance to annouce my
candidancy for President in 2012 under the Eisenhower party (don’t worry,
we’ll get the spelling right). You’ll see more on this later, but for now just
an annoucement to begin the longest presidential campaign in history (ok, well
the longest next to this guy anyway…).</p>
<p>Enjoy the toy, and we’ll see you next week for something completely
different…</p>
