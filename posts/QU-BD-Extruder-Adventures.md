<p>Awhile back I picked up a pair of <a href="http://store.qu-
bd.com/product.php?id_product=19" target="_blank"> QU-BD extruders </a> as part of their <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qu-bd/open-source-universal-3d-printer-
extruder-dual-ext" target="_blank"> Kickstarter campaign
</a> .  I purchased these after destroying my <a href="http://www.makergear.com/products/operators-pack" target="_blank"> Makergear hot-
end </a> (twice!) on my <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_(iteration_2)" target="_blank">
RepRap Prusa </a> .  After
half a year of wresting with the machine, the plan was to “buy my way out” of
extruder problems and get on with the printing.</p>
<p>Needless to say, things didn’t go as planned.</p>
<p>I won’t go into details here, but suffice to say the QU-BD extruders were not
a “bolt on and go” operation for me.  After struggling with them for a few
weeks and discussing simular issues with other users on their <a href="http://www.fabric8r.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?6-Official-QU-BD-
Troubleshooting-amp-Support-Forum" target="_blank"> support forum
</a> , I arranged to send my extruders back in
exchange for a pair that had been tested and known-good.</p>
<p>I am currently awaiting the arrival of these replacements.  Unfortunately the
pair I sent in checked-out as working by QU-BD staff so there’s probably no
chance of the new ones performing any differently unless I make some changes;
that’s what this series of blog posts will be about.</p>
<p>I’m in the process of assembling a list of things to try to get these
extruders to work with my setup.  I’ve found a number of things to change
about the way I was working with them before and a lot of ideas have been
gathered in the support forum since the last time I took a stab at it, so
there is hope.</p>
<p>I’ll be posting each experiment here under the <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/blog/?tag=qu-bd" target="_blank"> qu-bd tag
</a> in hopes that this
information will be useful to other QU-BD users in the future (as well as a
way for me to keep track of what works and what does not).</p>
