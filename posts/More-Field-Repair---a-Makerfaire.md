<p>Last week DONOR-1 required another service call to <a href="http://www.fdlpl.org/ideastudio" target="_blank">The Idea Studio</a>. This time it was squealing like a pig and with some help from Josh we were able to diagnose this as a problem with the coin acceptor. <img alt="2017-07-05 13-50-08 1010" src="/wp/2017/07/2017-07-05-13-50-08-1010.jpg"/> We waited about a week for the replacement part and headed to Fond du Lac to verify the diagnosis. It took about an hour of testing to rule out other possibilities but ultimately we replaced the entire unit and from then on the squealing subsided. We’re not sure exactly what went wrong with the original part, but it’s back in the lab now and scheduled for dissection. If you’d like to learn more about DONOR-1, where the idea came from and <a href="http://www.fdlpl.org/blog/2017/06/couple-explains-how-we-made-it-jul-19" target="_blank">how we made it</a>, we’ll be discussing just that at the <a href="http://www.fdlpl.org/ideastudio" target="_blank">Idea Studio</a> on <a href="http://www.fdlpl.org/blog/2017/06/couple-explains-how-we-made-it-jul-19" target="_blank">July 19th starting at 5:00PM</a>. There will be a brief presentation (including a look inside the machine) followed by a Q&amp;A session to answer any questions you may have about the idea, the machine or anything else you can think of. With any luck DONOR-1 will be up-and-running at the <a href="http://www.fdlpl.org/ideastudio" target="_blank">Idea Studio</a> until the time comes for it’s next mission. Speaking of which, DONOR-1’s next stop will be the <a href="https://milwaukee.makerfaire.com/maker/entry/55/" target="_blank">2017 Milwaukee Makerfaire</a>! DONOR-1 was accepted as a stand-alone exhibit which means you’ll be able to check it out anytime during the duration of the faire. We won’t be attending the machine all weekend, but we’re planning to make-up some signage to describe the project.</p>
