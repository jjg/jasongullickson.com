<p>I have to admit, I’m fanboy-ing over <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/tablets/lenovo/yoga-book/yoga-book-android/" target="_blank"> this new Lenovo
</a> a
bit.</p>
<p>Can we just look at that hinge for a moment…</p>
<p>I’m torn because I’m really not excited about having to choose between Android
and Windows (Android, obviously).  Like most Lenovo’s I imagine you could get
Linux to run on this thing but you’d be waiting a long time (and probably
writing drivers yourself) to make most of the interesting hardware work.</p>
<p>But then again, would I need to run anything other than <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank"> Evernote
</a> on it?</p>
<p>I’m pretty dubious about Android’s security, but perhaps there are solutions
to that at this point (this isn’t an iPhone vs. Android question, it’s an
Android vs. Linux one).  If I can find ways to satisfactorily mitigate
Android’s holes then I could probably live with this thing running Android
because it would amount to  little more than a kernel for Evernote.</p>
<p>It looks like the street price is going to be around $500.00, but I wasn’t
able to get a lock on release date.  I’d also like to lay hands on it before
making a decision as I’m really picky about keyboards.  That said, regardless
of how well the pen and keyboard work, it would be a significant upgrade from
anything I’ve used before, and a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Plus, I just like supporting people who have what it takes to bring something
cool to market (cough, _<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Courier" target="_blank"> Microsoft
</a> _ cough)</p>
