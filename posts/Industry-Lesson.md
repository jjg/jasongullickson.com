<div class="content">
<p>If you’re going to solicit customers as a web designer- developer/whatever,
it’s a good idea to have a website that works:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.katymarketing.com/" target="_blank"> can you find the content? </a></p>
<p>I’m not trying to poke fun at anyone here, but this seems to be another “how
many businesses can I run out of my home” operation (did you find the home
inspection link? what the?).</p>
<p>If you’re going to do something like this and specialize in, oh I don’t know,
five or six things, you might want to at least buy a few different domains and
build doorway pages to make it look like you’re an expert or something.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m just ranting, but this is why when I answer an RFP I come in twice
as high as some of the companies on the list….only to loose the work and
come back a year later to clean up after the web designer/home
inspector/advertising agency/accouting firm who doesn’t realize that this is
software design, not a catalog, not a quilt, not plumbing and you need to
apply some real development and project management methodologies to a
commercial website, instead of the crap you see here (or here for that
matter).</p>
<p>But I digress, who am I to critique another person’s business or website, what
do I know?</p>
