<p>A couple weeks ago DONOR-1 took a roadtrip to <a href="https://milwaukee.makerfaire.com/" target="_blank">Milwaukee Makerfaire</a>! <img alt="img_6320-e1507298900939.png" src="/wp/2017/10/img_6320-e1507299020451.png"/> The excitement began with a very nice write-up of the project (as well as some other things we’ve worked on) in a <a href="https://makezine.com/2017/09/15/maker-spotlight-jason-jamie-liberty-kratz-gullickson/" target="_blank">Maker Spotlight post</a> on the <a href="https://makezine.com/" target="_blank">Make Magazine</a> blog. Friday night before the faire we headed to <a href="http://www.fdlpl.org/ideastudio" target="_blank">The Idea Studio</a> to pick-up the machine. The Idea Studio was a great place to host DONOR-1 and the crew there was sad to see it go. <img alt="IMG_1525" src="/wp/2017/10/img_1525.jpg"/> After figuring out how to fit three people, the control panel, a dolly and assorted other bits into our little Jeep, we strapped DONOR-1 to <a href="http://jjg.2soc.net/2017/06/12/harbor-freight-folding-utility-trailer-build/" target="_blank">the trailer</a> and headed home. Saturday morning we hit the road early to make it to the fairgrounds before 8:00AM. This was my first experience driving around Milwaukee with a trailer and it wasn’t as bad as I expected. That said we still managed to get a little lost (Milwaukee likes to move their roads around) so we were a little bit late to the faire. <img alt="IMG_1529" src="/wp/2017/10/img_1529.jpg"/> DONOR-1 was a stand-alone exhibit which means we got a chance to check-out the rest of the faire this year. That being the case we didn’t get to meet everyone who checked it out, but we grabbed a few snapshots and received some photos from friends who played it after the faire. [gallery ids=“4775,4776,4777” type=“rectangular”] Sunday afternoon I headed back to the faire to pick-up DONOR-1 and was pleased to see it was not only operational, but there was even a line of people waiting to play! I waited about 45 minutes for a break in traffic to shut it down, but eventually I just had to get in line and wait my turn to switch it off and roll it out to the trailer. Overall it looks like DONOR-1 got a work-out and thankfully survived the weekend. I would love to know how many games were played (this is a feature we wanted to add but it hasn’t been home long enough to get it implemented). <img alt="IMG_1552" src="/wp/2017/10/img_1552.jpg"/> There were <a href="https://milwaukee.makerfaire.com/makers-exhibits/" target="_blank">so many other cool things</a> at the faire that it would take several posts to enumerate our favorites. We’re already looking forward to seeing what shows up next year. Now that DONOR-1 is back home we’re planning to do a little maintenance and perhaps add a few features we didn’t have time to add before it hit the road. That said we’re looking to line-up DONOR-1’s next fundraiser so if you’d like to host the machine to raise funds for a charity <a href="http://jjg.2soc.net/contact/" target="_blank">let us know</a>. One final note: DONOR-1 is entered in the 2017 <a href="https://hackaday.io/prize" target="_blank">Hackaday Prize</a>! If you like the project please visit the <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/27172-donor-1" target="_blank">DONOR-1 Hackaday.io page</a> and “like” (the skull &amp; crossbones button below the photos) the project, thanks!</p>
