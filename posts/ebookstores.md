For years I've considered purchasing an [e-ink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper)-based reading device but couldn't quite bring myself to spend the money when I have other ways to do it.  This may partially be due to never getting over how quickly my old e-ink [Kindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Third_generation) died (lasted less than a year) and how disappointing that was as I really loved using it.

This time around I discovered that there's a whole new class of devices that combine both reading and writing.  I've known of one or two devices like this but I didn't realize how many choices have come to market since the last time I looked into it.

Since a device like this would seriously streamline my workflow I decided to take the plunge and invest in one of these devices.  After mulling over the options (and doing a lot of reading) I settled on the [BOOX Note Air 2](https://onyxboox.com/boox_noteair2).

While I'm waiting for it to arrive I decided to look into what alternatives there are to [Amazon](https://amazon.com) for sources of new books.  In particular I'm interested in places that offer books in PDF or other non-[DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) formats, but I accept that it's not always going to be possible to avoid DRM.

So far I've found a couple interesting options.  I'll share what I've found here, and update the post as I discover more and have more experience with the sources listed here.

This one seemed so obvious that I was surprised that it's actually pretty great.  I haven't purchased a book from them yet, but the selection is good and I'm particularly excited about the fact that they [encourage authors to publish without DRM](https://about.ebooks.com/should-we-sell-your-ebooks-without-drm/).  Another noteworthy feature is that they sell DRM-free versions of [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) books (which O'Reilly no longer does).
