<p>Now that 1.0 is complete, what I have in mind next for Preposterous is trying
to put it to use as-is on a daily basis.  This means treating it like my
primary blog, and looking for ways to migrate old blog content over and setup
a custom domain, etc.</p>
<p>None of this should be showstopper stuff, but I’m going to try to make a
conscious effort to keep my hands off the code for a bit (maybe up to a week)
and really feel what should be done next by using it and gathering feedback
from other users.</p>
<p>In the meantime if there’s something you think belongs in Preposterous or you
find a bug, be sure to post it to the Issue tracker on the Github page (
<a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposterous" target="_blank">https://github.com/jjg/preposterous</a> ).</p>
