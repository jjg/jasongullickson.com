2021 is the year I finally do some FPGA development. Now that a complete open
source toolchain is available there’s no more excuses.

I’m using a tool called apio for now, it seems to work well if you use the
right usb cable.

Like other hardware platforms the blinking led is the “ _Hello World_ ” of
FPGA dev.

Sadly moments after I got this working, the Raspberry Pi 400 I was using to do
the work croaked. I’m not sure what happened but that put an abrupt end to the
experiments.
