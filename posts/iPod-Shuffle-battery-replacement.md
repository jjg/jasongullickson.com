<div class="content">
<p>I like to fix things and my mother gave me a particularly interesting
challenge. The battery had died in her second-generation iPod Shuffle, and she
wanted to get it replaced.</p>
<p>Of course the first question most people ask is why; why not just replace it,
it’s certainly less work and probably even cheaper than buying the parts. That
may be true (to some degree), but she was attached to it, and she’s not the
kind of person who just throws things away that can be fixed (or improved!),
so she asked me to take a look at it.</p>
<p>I found the idea intriguing because it fits into a category of work I find
relaxing. it’s in an area of work that I’m comfortable with (electronics),
it’s not particularly mysterious (the process is well-known) but it also
requires skill and patients. It’s also a low-risk job because the device is
already “dead”, an no-one else is interested in repairing it, so if something
goes wrong the outcome isn’t any worse than the origin.</p>
<p>My go-to source for these types of jobs is <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/" target="_blank"> fixit.com
</a> . They have the parts, tools and documentation
needed to make work (especially work on Apple products) go smoothly. Of course
I probably should have looked a little closer at the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPod+Shuffle+2nd+Generation+Battery+Replacement/3656" target="_blank"> 2nd gen iPod Shuffle

</a>
, because I didn’t notice that the job required soldering until I started
prying the thing apart.</p>
<p>Like most small Apple electronics, the shuffle is held together largely by
adhesives; Apple clearly has no interest in producing serviceable hardware.
That said the device is otherwise well-made which makes repair less
treacherous than fixing something where the screws are stripped (or so cheap
the heads come off when you turn them), or the parts are forced together, etc.
Once the glued-on covers are free the rest of the disassembly is done with
triple-zero Phillips screws and flexing tiny spring clips.</p>
<p>The real trick is disconnecting the old battery and reconnecting the new one.
This requires soldering, which I don’t mind but there’s a couple of
complications to this job. The first is that the leads and pads are very
small, not quite SMD small but tiny, less than a few mm long and soldered
pretty close together on the board. The second problem is that they are
located next to a steel spring clip that is mounted at a right-angle to the
board, which makes it hard to get into the area with any tools. The third
problem is that you’re dealing with a potentially charged li-ion battery with
no internal regulation, so short-circuits could <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/archive/lithium_ion_safety_concerns" target="_blank"> get exciting fast
</a> ,
and you’re using a conductive soldering iron to connect leads to pads on the
board which are perhaps 2-3mm apart.</p>
<p>Desoldering went rather smooth. I put the motherboard in my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B61D22/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jjg00-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B000B61D22&amp;linkId=6b6d2cf838b1ce97f473ef3fc49ddfbd" target="_blank"> Panavise

and used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EKQ7FY4/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jjg00-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00EKQ7FY4&amp;linkId=235a2ded805a11355c739ee4b4563bd9" target="_blank"> hemostat

to hold each wire in turn while heating the solder and pulling gently. They
popped-off without a lot of drama and other than being careful to not cross
the leads, it was all rather uneventful. Attaching the new battery was another
matter.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m just getting old, but the pads and leads were small enough that I
needed to use a jeweler’s loupe to see what i was doing while fishing the
leads of the new battery around the steel clip and on to the board. This means
having my face a couple cm from the work, and the soldering iron. I was
pleasantly surprised to not have branded myself at this point.</p>
<p>Once the soldering was over it was simply a matter of reversing the
disassembly steps to return the device to its original form. There were a
couple of snags getting things to fit right, and afterwards there was still a
gap on one side where I think the aluminum of the case flexed while I was
prying it apart, but the music played and the controls worked correctly, so I
can’t complain too much about the fit and finish.</p>
<p>Overall it was about an hour’s worth of work and a relaxing way to spend a
Saturday morning. It’s too bad that so many of our devices are designed to be
disposable, because I think there are others like me who enjoy the distraction
of this kind of work, and would be willing to do it regularly if there was any
way to make a living at it.</p>
<p>Rock-on Ma!</p>
