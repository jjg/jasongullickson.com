<p>The <a href="http://www.touchfire.com/" target="_blank"> TouchFire </a> is an iPad accessory designed to
make the iPad’s “soft” keyboard more like a real, physical keyboard.</p>

<p>I’m writing this review using the TouchFire as well, to get some idea of how
it works as a new user and compare this over time.</p>
<p>Right off the bat it takes some getting used to. Part of this is because the
keyboard fees unlike anything else I’ve typed on before; it feels a bit like
bubble wrap. The other thing that is strange is, having using the iPad
onscreen keyboard for a long time, remembering to treat it like a regular
keyboard (resting your fingers on the home row, for example) takes some
getting used to.</p>

<p>That said I was able to see an improvement in typing speed almost immediately,
and as I type this review, it’s becoming better and better.</p>
<p>There is also a stickiness to the keyboard that is a little weird but I’ve
heard that goes away with use, so we’ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>My larger concern is with the storage of the keyboard. Neatly, it is very thin
and folds up nicely into the Apple Smart Cover on my iPad 2, but I worry about
it becoming deformed by the pressure of the cover or by the pressure of my
hand holding the device closed. I also worry that it may get creased by
accident if I’m not careful closing it an I accidentally fold-over part of the
keyboard when I’m closing the cover. Perhaps I’m just being paranoid, but
again, we will see.</p>
<p>I’ll be doing some more writing with the keyboard over the next week which
should give me enlighten time to get over any “learning curve” associated with
the device as well as break-in the plastic and see how it holds up over daily
use. After this I’ll be posting a follow-up review to share my findings.</p>
