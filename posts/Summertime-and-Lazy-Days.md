<p>After publishing this week’s <a href="https://jjg.2soc.net/category/findday/" target="_blank">FindDay</a> post I realized that the last three posts on this blog have been FindDay’s, which means it’s been almost a month since I’ve written about any of our own projects.  This might give you the impression that not much has been going on around the laboratory. Actually, there’s a lot going on, but I haven’t had much time to write about any of it.  In fact I’ve barely found time to get the FindDay posts out.  This is a drag because I’m really looking forward to writing about some of the things we’ve been working on. A few of the things that are in the backlog:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utility trailer build</li>
<li><a href="https://jjg.2soc.net/category/charity-arcade/" target="_blank">DONOR-1</a> update</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=3707" target="_blank">Pinebook</a> review &amp; getting started guide</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jjg/storyphone" target="_blank">Storyphone</a> revival</li>
<li>Quick &amp; easy little free library build</li>
<li>A new 3D printer project</li>
<li>…everything else I can’t think of right now
I’m going to try to set-aside some time to get these written-up in the next few weeks.  In the meantime enjoy the weather and happy hacking!</li>
</ul>
