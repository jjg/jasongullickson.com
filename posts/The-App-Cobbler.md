<div class="content">
<p>So many Apps in the App Store that seem to burst onto the scene but over time
wither and die.</p>
<p>Sometimes because they went bust, sometimes because their creators ran out of
steam and certainly many times for many other reasons.</p>
<p>What if there were an App Cobbler, a skilled and clever software artisan who
would take these apps and resole them, like a traditional cobbler would a
quality shoe, returning or perhaps surpassing their original value?</p>
<p>Of course there are some shoes that are cheap and not worth fixing, and some
apps like this as well; but for those who bear quality, but perhaps suffer
from wear or neglect, perhaps an app cobbler should exist?</p>
