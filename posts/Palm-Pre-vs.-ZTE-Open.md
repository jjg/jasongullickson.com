<p>My friend Matt asked me what I thought of the Palm Pre 2 compared to my
Firefox phone (a ZTE Open).  It was more than I could fit in a Twitter
message, so thought I’d turn it into a blog post.</p>
<p>In a way the two phones are very similar in that they both provide a platform
which treats HTML5 web apps like first-class native applications.  On the
other hand, one (the Pre), represents the end of the line, the most mature
version of a product with this vision.  The Firefox phone represents the
beginning of a similar vision.</p>
<p>The Pre 2 (and WebOS) is polished and sophisticated, but frozen in 2010.  It
has clever, well-thought-out interactions and beautifully designed graphic
elements.  Performance is good, on par with other devices of it’s time and the
hardware fits together well and is solid and robust.  The Pre 2 was a premium
device and it shows, and includes features like inductive charging that are
still considered exotic in most phones.</p>
<p>The ZTE on the other hand is a primitive device, designed to be inexpensive.
It’s well-made compared to other phones in its price range, but that said it’s
far from luxurious.  The processor is slow, the camera is feeble and the
touchscreen is limited to one touch at a time.  Even so, the device performs
admirably given its humble components and is surprisingly useable for a device
that can be had for less than $100 USD without a contract.  Hardware aside,
the real star of the show is Firefox OS.  Like WebOS, FFOS gives web apps
access to device features that other platforms reserve for native applications
only.  This gives web developers much more creative latitude than other
platforms, and opens the door for mobile software that is truly device
independent.</p>
<p>So which is better?  Well, if nothing else you could say that the ZTE Open w/
Firefox OS is the right choice because the Pre is a dead-end product.  While
WebOS does continue on as an open-source project, and there are some companies
intending to release products based on it, they are things like television
sets and at the moment it looks like there’s no plans for another WebOS phone
from anyone.  Additionally, many of the existing WebOS apps no longer function
because they are built against older versions of service API’s that have been
depreciated, so for example while there are several great Twitter clients for
the Pre, none of them work with the current version of Twitter’s API.  This
doesn’t mean that the Pre is no longer useful, but unless you plan to maintain
the code, there’s no guarantee that the apps you use will continue to work as
time goes on.</p>
<p>On the flip side, there <em>is</em> an active open-source community producing new
code for WebOS, and even a package management system (“ <a href="http://preware.org/" target="_blank"> Preware
</a> ”) that makes finding and installing software from
these efforts easy.  So for the intrepid hacker, the Pre can be a useful
platform even if mainstream developer support has waned.</p>
<p>Conversely, the ZTE Open provides a basic platform for learning how to build
the mobile web apps of the future.  It’s clear that the Mozilla foundation
intends to back the Firefox OS effort for the foreseeable future, and as the
constraints of less-open platforms like Android and iOS become visible to more
and more users, adoption of FirefoxOS will grow.  This, coupled with the low
cost-of-entry for these devices, mean that time spent learning how to build
apps for FirefoxOS will likely be rewarded down the road.  If not in the hands
of well-off high-end smartphone consumers, then in the hands of those who are
first entering the smartphone market and others who see the platform as a
tonic to the aches and pains of other more established platforms.</p>
