<p>Just a quick note;</p>
<p>Myself and Matt will be appearing on Wisconsin Public Television’s “Directors’
Cut” tonight at 9:30PM Central. The show focuses primarily on our last
documentary “Breakdown” but near the end it also includes a sneak peak of the
Slimey Crud Run film as well (You can also view the entire episode online if
you can’t catch it on TV).</p>
