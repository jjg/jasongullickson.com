I received my [ Pangolin ](https://system76.com/laptops/pangolin) from [
System76 ](https://system76com/) about 24 hours ago. Here are my favorite
things so far:

  

* All the hardware works (if you've run Linux on a laptop before you can appreciate how cool this is) 

* The keyboard is good, probably the best laptop keyboard I've used 

* The trackpad is good enough that a mouse is not required 

* It is fast 

* It is stable 

* The installed Linux ( [ Pop! O/S ](https://pop.system76.com/) ) works well and is good enough so far that I haven't replaced it 

* I didn't really want a numeric keypad, but having page-up/page-down, home, end, etc. w/o modifier keys is _awesome_

  

I wasn't sure how I'd feel about Pop! O/S because I generally don't care for
Ubuntu and prefer a more slimmed-down distro. That said, I've been impressed
with Pop! so far, especially the additional features to make the GUI more
keyboard-oriented. So far I haven't found a reason to replace it which is
saying a lot.

  

I'm planning to write a much more in-depth review of the machine soon, but
right now I'm having too much fun using it to work on actual projects.
