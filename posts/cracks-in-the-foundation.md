I really need to finish some projects.

  

I find myself frequently hamstrung by tooling and process hang-ups which are
due to old incomplete projects blocking completion of new projects.

  

Do you see what’s going on here? _It is a feedback loop which causes
exponential delays into infinity._

  

Take Forevernote as an example. Evernote accelerated my work immensely because
I could get ideas down with almost no friction via almost any means and easily
retrieve it later for reference, iteration, etc. But Evernote became
untrustworthy and after an exhaustive failed search for a replacement, I
decided I had to build my own: **Forevernote** .

  

Like most projects I started with enthusiasm and made some initial progress,
but unlike other projects, this one was of interest only to me, and as such
there was no external motivation to complete it. As it only benefited me, and
there were work-arounds, Forevernote yielded to projects which had a wider
audience.

  

Now years later, my notes are scattered across several systems and retrieval
is more time-consuming than ever. In some cases I’ve lost project information
completely (ironically Forevernote is one of these projects...). These losses
impact other projects exponentially because notes and documentation are at the
root of everything I work on.

  

This is just one example of a class of “tooling” problems that I can never
seem to solve.
