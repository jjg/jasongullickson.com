<p>I should have written this a month ago.</p>
<p>I learned a lot this year at Makerfaire Milwaukee.  It was the first time I
attended a Makerfaire as a presenter (really my daughter was the star of the
show, but we hauled Sux0rz along for the ride), and it gave me a new
perspective on the event.</p>
<p>The biggest take-away for me was the enormous amount of work put in by the
team putting on the event.  They were on-site working when we got there
Saturday morning and after we left Sunday night.</p>
<p>I also learned that attending as a maker is something I want to do again</p>
