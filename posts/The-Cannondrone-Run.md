<p>The idea is simple: A cross-country race between drone aircraft, inspired by
the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
/Cannonball_Baker_Sea-To-Shining-Sea_Memorial_Trophy_Dash" target="_blank"> Cannonball Run </a> .  Explaining the
purpose is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>Drone technology has evolved quickly over the last decade and is at a point
where off-the-shelf quadcopters capable of doing useful things (flying cameras
around, etc.) can be had for under $100USD.  This is pretty cool, and it also
has had some negative side-effects.</p>
<p>I think this technology could have some significant life-improving
applications, but I believe that it is in danger of the same kind of “ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing" target="_blank">
satisficience </a> “ that has been
reached in computers, mobile phones, etc.</p>
<p>The proposed race will push both the technological and the sociological limits
of what is being done with consumer drone technology today, and the
development of technology necessary to compete (or even complete) the race
will dramatically broaden the application possibilities for drones.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example: One pro-social use of drones would be to deliver
library books to rural communities, however the most common quad-copter-style
drones lack the range to do this on their own.  In order to compete in this
race, advances in battery capacity, en-route charging or in-flight charging
would need to be developed, which would then allow drones to be used for this
application.</p>
<p>Another important aspect to the race is that it pushes the boundaries of the
law.  Based on current FAA requirements a drone can only be operated within
line-of-sight of the operator.  This means that in order to participate in the
race, the operator will either need to find a way to meet this requirement, or
develop technologies that can evade detection and capture.  There are a number
of creative solutions to these problems that I can imagine (and countless more
that I can’t) and both have very practical application in positive drone use
scenarios.  A technology that allows an operator to preserve line-of-sight
operation increases safety and potentially social interaction with drone work.
A technology that avoids detection will also avoid collisions with other
aircraft, and be capable of delivering packages in a more secure fashion.</p>
<p>One final advantage to the somewhat “outlaw” nature of the race is that it
will discourage corporations from direct involvement.  The have too much to
loose if they get caught, and there’s no “branding” opportunity in the
traditional sense.  This will encourage independent participation and foster
technological development at the grassroots level where it is less likely to
become encumbered with intellectual property constraints or compromised in
order to be “monitizable”.</p>
<p>There are countless other advantages that I won’t attempt to enumerate here.
What I will share is what I see as the essential elements of how the race
should be held:</p>
<p>1.  The first race should be coast-to-coast in the United States as a nod to
the event that it’s based on.  Races elsewhere are very much encouraged, but
key is that there is sufficient geographical distance to force anyone
participating to come up with technology beyond what’s available off-the-
shelf.</p>
<p>2.  The start point of the race is announced in advance, but the end point is
not announced until the race has begun, ideally in a way that only
participants are aware of it.</p>
<p>3.  Cooperation will be rewarded</p>
<p>There may be other constraints, but I really don’t want to make it
complicated.  The idea being that any kind of “cheating” serve the higher goal
of encouraging open, independent research &amp; development to take drone
technology to the next level, and open a new frontier of applications.  The
secondary goal is to push the social and political boundaries of how drones
can be used and derive intelligent ways to address the fears that result in
restrictive legislation.</p>
<p>If this piques your interest I’ve setup a room to discuss the pros, cons,
risks and rewards of such a race (should it ever take place) at <a href="https://hack.chat/?cannondronerun" target="_blank">
