<p>The <a href="http://2soc.net/crudrundiaries/" target="_blank"> Crud Run Diaries </a> has finally been
“greenlighted” by <a href="http://2soc.net/" target="_blank"> the second society </a> . What this means
is that it will now occupy an “official” spot on the production schedule and
things should really start rolling from here.</p>
<p>What happens next is we will be scheduling interviews with anyone involved in
the Run’s history as well as time to record major mechanical work on the
project bikes (which means I need to get a list of to-fix items for the CL).
The first of these sessions will be recorded on <strong>September 9th</strong> so I’ll have
more to report on after that.</p>
<p>A few other decisions have been made and due to scheduling conflicts (and
frankly, lack of progress on the project bikes) we’re targeting the spring Run
of 2008 to get the bikes running and on the road. This will give us most of
the winter to get the work done, and since we live in Wisconsin, there’s not a
lot else to do, really…</p>
<p>In the meantime we are looking for stories from anyone who participates or
even knows something about <strong>The Slimy Crud Run</strong> . If you or someone you know
falls into this category drop a comment on this post and we’ll get in touch.</p>
