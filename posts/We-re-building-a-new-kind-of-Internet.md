<p>I think it’s hard to understand the logic behind the systems I’ve been
designing lately if you don’t understand that <em>we’re trying to build a new
kind of Internet</em> .</p>
<p>To be sure, it’s not completely new, at least not yet.  We’re still relying on
the underlying TCP/IP network protocol (at least for now), but even there
we’re focused on IPv6 and not letting the baggage of IPv4 hold back anything
interesting.  Above the protocol layer though, things are much different from
how most people currently understand the Internet, and in particular, the Web.</p>
<p>To most people the Web <em>is</em> the Internet.  I’m frequently frustrated by this
but I understand why it’s the case.  It’s not unlike how email was once known
to millions as “AOL”, and how, if we allow the trend to continue, most people
will start calling Facebook the “internet”.</p>
<p>Given this it’s easy to see why even programmers minds are a bit melted when
they try to consume the type of services and architectures that we’re
proposing, because they’re designed for a future network that doesn’t
completely exist today.  We’re designing for a network that in some ways looks
a lot like the ancient Internet, even before the existence of Internet Service
Providers (ISP’s).  Our vision is a worldwide network of independent systems
which can cooperate voluntarily or operate completely on their own, capable of
seamless and dynamic resource sharing and unencumbered by non-technical
baggage.  A network accessible by every intelligence on Earth equally, without
financial or intellectual tariffs and surcharges, and without gatekeepers or
profiteers simply operating turnstiles that exist only to extract value from
users and contribute no actual processing capacity.</p>
<p>This might sound impossible or idealistic, perhaps utopian (unless you make a
living shaking down Internet users, in which case perhaps “nightmarish” comes
to mind) and to be fair it’s not a small undertaking, but it breaks down into
smaller parts somewhat nicely, some which we don’t yet have the technology or
influence necessary, but others which we can start building <em>right now</em> .</p>
<p>One of the steps we can take today is to stop building systems incapable of
existing in such a model.  In some ways this means systems become more
independent, capable of stand-alone operation, but in other ways it means that
systems become more open, capable of integration with known and unknown
systems in seamless and dynamic ways.  In our current view of what an
“application” is, this seems paradoxical, but part of the new way is
increasing the granularity of applications, not unlike previous efforts in
separating data from logic and display in the Model-View-Controller
application architecture, or the emergence of REST/Web API’s.</p>
<p>However this division not only goes the direction of application <em>code</em> , but
also in <em>data</em> as well.  By using data structures that represent information
completely, independent of relationship to other documents, we can eliminate
dependencies that constrain existing applications to “always online”
operation, and lay the foundation for networks that can change much more
dramatically without disrupting continuity.  This is a significant change from
the silo design currently popular for Internet applications, and even the idea
of servers themselves.</p>
<p>I’ll elaborate more in a later post.  In the meantime if you’re working with
us on a project, and something we’ve designed seems weird or over complicated,
keep in mind that we’re not designing a new application, but a new kind of
network as well.</p>
