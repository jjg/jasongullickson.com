title: "Print quality is getting better and more consistent"

<p>Here’s a few recent prints from my <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/projects/reprap/" target="_blank" title="RepRap"> Reprap
</a> .  After a
fair amount of tuning the quality has dramatically improved, but more
importantly, the consistency and repeatability is getting to a point where I
can print many simular and different parts, and they fit together with simular
tolerances.</p>

<p>The Ultimachine filament I picked up seems to have greater dimensional
stability than the Faberdashery samples I have, although the colors of the Fab
filament are nicer as the texture is a little more pleasant as well so I can
see why it’s popular.  For my purposes engineering accuracy is more important
so I’m happy the Ultimachine filament is fitting the bill in that regard.</p>

<p>One thing that came to my attention through the last tests is that I have one
of my axis inverted.  This seems like something you’d notice but since a lot
of the things I print are symmetrical  it wasn’t apparent until I printed some
objects with letters on them (or this iPhone case with the camera opening on
the wrong side…).</p>
