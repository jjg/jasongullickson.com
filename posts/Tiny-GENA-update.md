<p>The Mixtile folks posted a video of the GENA paired to an iPhone and that
encourages me enough to to start designing a case for it.</p>

<p>It’s not much to <em>look</em> at yet, but I’m iterating on a design.  Mixtile says
they will release 3D design files but I have no idea when, and it’s more fun
to make your own anyway.</p>
