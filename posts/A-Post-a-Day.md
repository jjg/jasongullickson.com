<p>As an experiment in motivation (and perhaps gumption generation) I’m going to
try to post here at least once a day for the month of August. I’m not
promising anything epic (although it’s hard to write a little) but each day
I’ll be posting something in an effort to make Preposter.us part of my daily
thoughts. This should make it clear to me if Preposter.us is valuable enough
to invest more time sanding down the edges, or of the time has come to work on
its successor. - Jason</p>
