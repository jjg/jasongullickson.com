<p>I’m thinking about “organizing” another Damcamp (Beaver Dam barcamp).</p>
<p>We did one a few years ago and it turned out pretty cool.  Nothing huge, but a
good mix of presentations and a lot of great conversations.</p>
<p>I think in the intervening years the community has become more interested in
this sort of event (or perhaps I’ve just come in contact with more of the
community).  So it might be time to revisit.</p>
