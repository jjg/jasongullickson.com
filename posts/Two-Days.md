<p>It’s interesting, the motorcycle thing.</p>
<p>In cars, most of the technology is driven by the needs of common, boring
street use. Motorcycle technology, on the other hand, seems to be driven
primarily by racing, secondarily by nostalgia or physical beauty.</p>
<p>There was a point back in the 1970’s or even late ‘60’s where motorcycle
technology matched automotive technology in every measurable way. From that
point on, bikes took the lead and now there’s no comparison.</p>
<p>So with the practical transportation aspirations of automobiles behind them,
bikes went down this bizarre road where the only reason to get excited about a
new bike is either numerical gains on the dyno or aesthetic (specifically,
visual) beauty. Marketing has honed this to an extent that to the general
public, motorcycling <strong>is</strong> these two things and all of the subtle nuances
which make riding great are lost (or at best, ignored).</p>
<p>To summarize, every motorcycle made today from the cheapest beginner bike to
the most expensive luxury liner is capable of performance exceeding anyone’s
“needs”, so if you’re going to continue to sell new motorcycles you have to
focus on things that change over time even though they are irrelevant to what
motorcyclists know it’s all about.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that we (the people who buy motorcycles) are responsible for
this. The evidence is that, throughout the history of the motorcycle (in
particular, the last two decades) when manufacturers dared to come out with a
model that circumvents this one-upmanship approach to sales, these models go
unsold. Often these models become appreciated only long after the manufacturer
has dropped them from production due to poor sales (the Hawk GT being an
excellent example, but there are many more).</p>
<p>I see electric bikes as a potential cure for this problem. This has nothing to
do with efficiency or performance but with the fact that they are different
enough from people’s expectations that we have a chance to reset the image of
what makes bikes sell (out of necessity really, because in the near term
electric bikes can’t compete with gasoline models on all measureable
performance fronts simultaneously). Honda did something like this back in the
1950’s when they first brought their bikes to the states (“You meet the nicest
people on a Honda”), the bikes were so different as to be perceived as a
different class of vehicle from the large hooligan-machines driven only by the
violent and the unwashed.</p>
<p>It would be an interesting intellectual experiment, to design a motorcycle
company to produce a product like this and tweak the variables until it
becomes sustainable (i.e., profitable). Similar things have been done before,
Saturn did something like this in automobiles (until their short-sighted
parent company pulled the plug on the philosophy and “burned the brand”).</p>
<p>…now I have something nice to think about this morning…</p>
<p><em>As you may have noticed, I don’t have any good news to share about the
project. With no title in hand the odds are not in favor of getting the bike
to the fall run. That’s all I’m going to say for now as the whole situation is
distressing and I’d rather change the topic.</em></p>
