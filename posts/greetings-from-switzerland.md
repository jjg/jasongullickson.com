Last weekend I migrated our servers from Linode to [ Data Center Light
](https://datacenterlight.ch/) . Overall the move went fairly smooth with only
one unexpected hiccup, and all systems appear to be operational at this point.

  

There are still some files and git repositories to move from the old server,
but I hope to wrap that up soon and shut it down by next week.
