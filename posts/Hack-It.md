<p>You may have noticed I had a brief flirtation with <a href="http://www.svbtle.com/" target="_blank"> svbtle
</a> , in fact the three posts I made are still over
there:</p>
<p><a href="http://jjg.svbtle.com/" target="_blank"> http://jjg.svbtle.com/ </a></p>
<p>It’s a really cool platform, simple, attractive and incorporates some of the
very ideas I’ve had over the years to support the cultivation of ideas.</p>
<p>However I was using it for the wrong reasons, and as nice as it is, it’s still
an old-world monolithic system based on centralized servers.  This isn’t a
direct criticism, it will serve many people well, but it’s not right for me,
and using it does nothing to improve Preposterous.</p>
<p>So I painstakingly moved my posts back to Preposterous, and committed myself
to figuring out why my custom domain suddenly broke.  In the process I
remembered some of the subtle reasons I fell in love with the Posterious model
in the first place, why I was compelled to re-create a part of it and learned
a little more about nginx and ipv6 along the way.</p>
<p>So for better or worse, <a href="http://gullicksonlaboratories.com" target="_blank"> gullicksonlaboratories.com
</a> is once again powered by Preposterous
(avaliable on both ipv4 and ipv6!), warts and all.  This will force me to
either improve it, or stop posting altogether.</p>
