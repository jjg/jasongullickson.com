<p>I just sent RC1 (Release Candidate 1) off to my beta group. I think it’s in
good shape, all known issues have been addressed and I’m very pleased with how
it’s turned out. I have allot of ideas for future releases but I’m trying to
stick to my original design goals for the first release to prevent the app
from getting stuck in continual beta mode.</p>
<p>If all goes well, I will be submitting the app to Apple in the next few days
and then it’s just the waiting game until I hear back. I guess I’ll take that
time and go to the bahamas* or something…</p>
<p>(* by Bahamas I mean, work on a bookshelf or something)</p>
