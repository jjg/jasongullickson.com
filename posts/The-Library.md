<p>So this week’s topic is a new project we’re working on we like to call the
library. The idea behind the library is to provide a place to keep track of
your digital media (currently dvd, cd, playstation and minidisc). My original
motivation for this was to make it easy for people who like to buy me this
stuff to know what I already have ; ), but it panned out into some more
interesting possibilities.</p>
<p>I think the primary usefulness of the library right now is that it provides
you a way to see if someone you know has something you’d like to borrow, and
also allows the borrower to keep track of who has what. We are also working on
some more features to make this more useful, and possibly more automated.</p>
<p>So in the meantime, hit www.jasongullickson.com/library/ and take a look at
what we’re working on now, and if you have any ideas, feel free to drop me a
line at mr@jasongullickson.com.</p>
