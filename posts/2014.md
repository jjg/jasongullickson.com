<p>At the end of each year some people try to predict what will happen over the
course of the new year.  I’m less inclined to try and map out what the rest of
the world will do in 2014, but I’ll take a stab at what I expect to do myself:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Finish writing my Reprap book</p></li>
<li><p>Complete the third version of the Murfie API</p></li>
<li><p>Release major-version-number version updates of the Murfie mobile apps</p></li>
<li><p>Add support for Murfie to a few more streaming playback devices</p></li>
<li><p>Build a prototype Recyclotron</p></li>
<li><p>Explore creating a maker/hackerspace with Jamie</p></li>
<li><p>More time camping</p></li>
<li><p>More time hacking on off-the-grid living at Kamp Kratz</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching Libby to hack her Chromebook</p></li>
<li><p>Developing collaborative CAD tools &amp; environments</p></li>
<li><p>Experiments with me2 and other exocortex-related development projects</p></li>
<li><p>Home repairs</p></li>
<li><p>More time paddling</p></li>
<li><p>Some time making music</p></li>
<li><p>Return to experimental filmmaking</p></li>
<li><p>3D Printing and Desktop Manufacturing teaching and ambassadorship</p></li>
<li><p>Experiments in the design and construction of electric vehicles</p></li>
<li><p>Release a compelling electronic publishing platform</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a pretty good sample of what seems likely to happen.  Of course theres
much more, and some of these may drop off, but at the moment they all seem
like good candidates to get some attention this year.</p>
<p>Can’t wait to see what you do with the new year!</p>
