title: "What's that smell?"

<p>Last weekend when I opened the garage door I was hit with the beautiful smell
of gasoline. After the initial pleasure of the aroma subsided, a more serious
thought entered my head:</p>
<p>“Why does the garage smell like gas?”</p>
<p>Of course my first suspect is the CL. I take a look under the tarp and sure
enough, there is a spot under the center stand that smells of fuel. Only a
stain remains, but there was definitely some sort of leaking going on.</p>
<p>I’m surprised by this because I tested the tank repeatedly after <a href="http://jasonscrudrundiary.blogspot.com/2008/08/sunshine-of-my-hate-
part-1.html" target="_blank"> lining it
</a> and found no leaks. I even replaced the petcock with a NOS one,
and it has been turned off ever since I <a href="http://jasonscrudrundiary.blogspot.com/2008/10/208-days.html" target="_blank"> parked
</a> the bike for
the winter.</p>
<p>I took a close look at the lines, the carbs and anywhere else that fuel flows
and found nothing. Of course the liquid fuel evaporated before I became aware
of the leak, but I was hoping to find some tell-tale residue or something
along those lines. Nothing.</p>
<p>So I moved the bike to a more level spot and kept an eye on it. Everything
seemed fine for a few days, then one morning, another spot.</p>
<p>Now when this happens, it’s not a lot of fuel, the spot is only about a foot
around and there is plenty of fuel left in the tank. My only guess is that it
has something to do with the +-30 degree temperature swings we’re experiencing
around here lately but I still can’t find the source and I’d like to address
this before the snow flies and I go a week or more without opening the door.</p>
