<p>February is Burn-down Month!</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been feeling like I may have too much work in-flight.  To address
this, I’m going to try to go an entire month with no new ideas, and instead
attempt to clear-out a number of projects that are taking up space in my head.
I’m not going to pretend that I won’t come up with new ideas during this
month, but like meditation I’ll acknowledge them and then put them away.</p>
<p>So for the month of February, 2015 I’ll be working on “burning down” this list
of projects, getting each to a state where it doesn’t demand my attention on a
daily basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSOS (includes media processing network, etc.)</li>
<li>WebVR support for OpenDive</li>
<li>SceneVR</li>
<li>Recyclotron</li>
<li>Chromebook for Developers</li>
<li>NodeLua/ESP8266</li>
<li>Wrist Reader</li>
<li>2soc.net</li>
<li>Mofos</li>
<li>The RPM Challenge</li>
<li>Botter</li>
<li>Tantillus</li>
<li>Some machine intelligence stuff</li>
<li>Some quantum computing stuff</li>
<li>A dozen other things that are not coming to mind</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of these are my own projects but they are all things that are
occupying my mind at the moment.  The plan is to finish the work where I have
work to do and to commit the rest to more durable memory (expect an increase
in blog posts next month).</p>
<p>Like everything else I do, this is an experiment, and the outcome may not
match the ambitions set forth at the beginning of the project.  Nevertheless
it will be a learning experience, and I intend to document the process along
the way.</p>
