Managed to spend a couple hours wrenching on Preposter.us and it's already
starting to look better!

One thing I'm particularly impressed with is the way the new layout formats
posts with a lot of photos. It will be interesting to see how that works when
there's more text and images interspersed, but right now I'm pretty happy with
it.

I'm also happy that I'm no longer using a custom font, and didn't have to
resort to loading external/remote fonts. In fact, right now Preposter.us
doesn't load _anything_ from outside of its own server (as it should be).
There's still some things about the design I'd like to improve, but overall
it's getting better faster than I expected, so much so that I might be ready
to start talking about the project more publicly soon.
