<p>So there is a lot of exciting developments around the film these days;
unfortunately none of them have to do with my motorcycle.</p>
<p>I’ve had the carb rebuild kits for at least a month and the pipes in the
basement for weeks, but with the schedule lately I’ve had zero time to spend
down there getting things together.</p>
<p>With any luck things will wind down here in the next week or so and I’ll get a
chance to do some work on the bike. The weather around here has been
improving, making it a lot easier to get work done out in the garage. Once I
get the carbs and pipes done I’ll be digging the rest out and moving
operations back outside for the warmer months.</p>
<p>In the meantime I’ll be focusing on my “Producer” role of the project and less
on the “Mechanic” one; but hopefully that will change soon.</p>
