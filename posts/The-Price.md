<p>In 1995 I declared that you can own a motorcycle for $1000.00. This was in
response that I gave anyone who was interested in getting started in
motorcycling but thought it was too expensive based on the going rate of new
motorcycles at the time.</p>
<p>The principle is this: If you spent $1000.00 on a used bike you could find one
that ran and was in good enough shape to ride at least for one season. If you
spent $500.00 on a used bike, you’d probably need to put another $500.00 into
it (typically battery, tires, etc.) to get it ready for serious riding. The
same goes for $250.00/$750.00, $0.00/$1000.00, etc.</p>
<p>I think this general rule still holds true today, although I might bump the
base cost to something like $1200.00.</p>
<p>I’ve started <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com" target="_blank"> Google Spreadsheet </a> (still
trying to figure out how to share it with the general public) to track the
cost of my little project here to see if this theory still holds true in the
year 2007.</p>
