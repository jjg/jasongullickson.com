Originally, I intended to use an <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/mwhelectronics/atmega328p-breakout-board/" target="_blank">Atmega328p breakout board</a> as the brains of the operation, and develop the firmware using the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino IDE</a>.  The rest of the electronics consisted of the stepper motor drivers that came with the motors (based on the <a href="http://www.superdroidrobots.com/product_info/ULN2003APG.pdf" target="_blank">ULN2003APG IC</a> ) and a battery power supply.  Revisiting the project now I think something more sophisticated like a Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer" target="_blank">SBC</a> might make the robot more useful, both in terms of expanding the potential applications and making development more approachable via a wider range of tools, languages, etc. Personally, I’m interested in exploring the idea of using the design to produce an inexpensive telepresense robot, perhaps something capable of interfacing with <a href="http://www.runmyrobot.com/" target="_blank">runmyrobot.com</a>. In any event I’ve decided to revive the project and work on giving it a new brain.  At the moment I’m planning to experiment with driving the motors using a <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/jjg00-20/detail/B01CD5VC92" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> (because that’s the platform of choice for runmyrobot).  But, given the size of a standard Raspberry Pi (and the cost of getting a properly-outfitted Raspberry Pi Zero), I’m probably going to choose something else in the long run, perhaps Next Thing Co.’s CHIP, or some other Open Source Hardware ARM-based Linux SBC.  Regardless of the final choice, it needs to be small, low-power and obtainable.</p>
