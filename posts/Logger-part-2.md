<p>I’ve doing alot of thinking and not much building on the logger I mentioned
last week, but in the case that was a good thing.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I can use a simple voltage divider to wrangle the input
voltage (~0-15vdc, I hope) into something the arduino can deal with (0-5vdc).
Much simpler than I thought.</p>
<p>I probably will need to order a 0-5vdc meter though instead of using the 12v
one I have on-hand since I can’t find an equally simple way to step-up the 5v
from the board to 12 (at least not using parts I have in stock).</p>
<p>I could forgo the meter (just use LED’s) but what fun would that be?</p>
<p>So hopefully this weekend I’ll get a chance to work on the case and such and
do a dry-run with a smaller solar panel I have in the basement. If that goes
well I’ll get the rest of the parts ordered and get it ready for the real test
in the cabin in November.</p>
<p>I’m still planning on taking only one measurement but if this goes well (and I
can get some external memory working) I’ll add a few more inputs to measure
pre-charge-controller voltage, amperage, temperature and maybe battery voltage
(as opposed to charging voltage) as well.</p>
