<p>After replacing the tiny, strange and <em>very inefficient</em> bulbs in our hallway
lights upstairs once again we decided to find a replacement that could work
with common CF or LED bulbs.</p>
<p>One of the problems with old houses is that they don’t always have modern
junction boxes (in our case, never), and most new fixtures, etc. expect this.
In this case it means that the tiny little base of the new lamp can’t possibly
hold all the wiring involved.</p>
<p>There is probably an existing, off-the-shelf solution to this but I haven’t
seen one that I love, and even if there was, they often require on-site
customization that ends up looking less than awesome (at least when I do it).</p>
<p>Of course once you’ve built a 3D printer, every problem looks like a modeling
problem, so instead of wasting time looking for another thing to buy to solve
the problem I took a few measurements and fired up <strong>OpenSCAD</strong> .</p>

<p>It’s always tempting to do something fancy when you’re designing parts to be
3D printed, as “complexity is cheap” but all I really needed was a tube of the
right diameter and height so other than adding a little lip to keep things
aligned I left the scroll-work and gargoyles out of this version.  Also with a
limited amount of Black PLA on-hand and with a 3+ hour print time I didn’t
want to take unnecessary chances.</p>
<p>At 125mm diameter this is one of the widest prints I’ve attempted in a long
time.  Printing anything larger than 100mm has been a challenge with this
printer so this job would be a good test of the recent upgrades and
improvements I’ve made.</p>

<p>Fortunately, other than some “wandering spool” problems the print completed
without a hitch and the part came out fine.  I’m not sure if that’s due to
better calibration on my part or perhaps the new gluestick I’m using to
prepare the print bed, but in either case I’m planning to try some more
ambitious prints to see just how far I can push the printer now dimension-
wise.</p>

<p>While the base was printing I realized that I’d also need one of those little
“hook” things to feed the cord through so the lamp could hang from a specific
part of the ceiling (not directly under where the previous lamp had been).
Here again this is probably something you can find off-the-shelf, but with 10
minutes of CAD time and about 15 minutes of print time (and a few pennies of
plastic) I was able to have one in-hand and ready to use without wasting time
and fuel driving around town.</p>

<p>With these parts in hand I was able to finish the job that afternoon without
having to make any more “parts runs”, and minimal additional cost besides my
time.  You could argue that the time cost a lot more than the money it would
have cost to purchase these parts, but I don’t think it would have taken a lot
less time to find them and purchase them, and the time I spent modeling and
printing them not only got the job done, but it made me a better modeler and
designer, and taught me new things about the printer as well.</p>
<p>It’s this last part that is really the redeeming value of DIY in my eyes.
When you do something yourself it may not be less expensive in strict
financial terms, but the time and money spent is spent making you smarter, and
less dependent.  I think this is good for both you and the world you
participate in, especially if you then share your experience so others can
learn from it as well.</p>
