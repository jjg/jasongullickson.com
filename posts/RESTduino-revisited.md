<p><a href="https://github.com/jjg/RESTduino" target="_blank"> RESTduino </a> is a little Arduino sketch I
wrote a few years back for the Arduino Ethernet shield.  The idea was to make
it easy for web developers to talk to the Arduino hardware using a REST-style
interface.</p>
<p>The other day when I logged into <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank"> Github </a> I saw a big
string of people starring the project, which surprised me because it’s a bit
old and I haven’t updated it in awhile.  Turns out that someone recently used
RESTduino as an ingredient in a recipe for <a href="http://delian.io/siri-open-the-garage" target="_blank"> opening and closing their garage
door using Siri </a> (with a particularity
clever way of working around Siri’s lack of a public API).</p>
<p>While I was poking around in the Github stats I also ran across a company
selling an integrated Arduino/WiFi board called “ <a href="http://shop.wickeddevice.com/resources/wildfire/" target="_blank"> WiLD FiRE
</a> “ that ships with
RESTduino as the stock firmware, how cool!</p>
<p>There’s just something really awesome about finding your work out there making
it easier for people you don’t know to build cool things.  I remember
hesitating publishing RESTduino because I thought it was too simplistic,
something anyone could write if they bothered, or too incomplete/buggy/etc.
Finding examples of it taking on a life of its own like this is an awesome
reminder of the power of open-source, and that you should share as much of
your work as you can regardless of what you think it may be worth.</p>
