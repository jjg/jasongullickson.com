<div class="content">
<p>I’ve sucessfully <a href="/tags/preposterous">imported the archives</a> from my longest-running <a href="https://gitlab.com/jgullickson/preposter.us" target="_blank">Preposterous</a> blog!</p>
<p>There’s still some kinks to work out (in particular, a bunch of posts are convinced they are from the year <strong>0001</strong>), but the script works well enough that I didn’t want to leave the content offline until I worked out the last few kinks.</p>
<p>Most of this content hasn’t seen the light-of-day for years and it’s very exciting for me to see some of it again.  A lot of it is weird debugging posts I made as I was developing Preposterous so it may be of little interest to others, but for me it’s kind of cool to see the project evolve.</p>
<p>Even though I stopped pursing it, Preposterous is a project I’m very fond of.  It’s a great example of what you can do with very little resources when sufficiently enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Hopefully these posts will be of some interest to others as well.  They are listed chronologically alongside <a href="/posts/">the other posts</a> on this site, or you can get an index of the imported content only by viewing the <a href="/tags/preposterous/">Preposterous tag</a>.</p>
