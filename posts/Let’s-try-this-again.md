<div class="content">
<p>Years ago (looks like 2013?) I used <a href="http://postach.io/" target="_blank"> Postach.io </a> to
publish my blog.  I made a number of entries, and even wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jjg/wp2evernote" target="_blank"> Wordpress-to-
Evernote importing tool </a> to facilitate
the move, but for reasons I can’t remember it didn’t work out, and I abandoned
it, switching to yet another blog platform (maybe that was when I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposter.us" target="_blank">
Preposter.us </a> ?).</p>
<p>Anyway, I received an apologetic email from the people at Postach.io and
decided to give it another try.  Since most of my writing originates in
Evernote anyway, if Postach.io works, it would save me considerable time and
effort, and would also get the desire to keep (re)building my own blog
platform off my plate.</p>
<p>So here’s to second chances.</p>
