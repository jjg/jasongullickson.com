<div class="content">
<p>Something I’d like to have is an agent that I can submit ideas to that will
run around and dig up relevant information, similar ideas and conversations
that might shed light on pursuing the work.  Sort of like a compiler or linker
for new ideas or projects.</p>
<p>Today I’m going to spend some time (ironically) researching if such a thing
already exists, or could be cobbled together using existing search API’s, etc.</p>
