<p>You’re probably already familiar with <a href="https://tindie.com/" target="_blank"> Tindie </a> (a sort
of <a href="http://www.etsy.com" target="_blank"> Etsy </a> for electronics), well they just announced a
feature today that might interest you hardware hackers: <a href="https://tindie.com/shops/fundraisers/" target="_blank"> Tindie Fundraisers
</a> . <a href="https://tindie.com/shops/fundraisers/" target="_blank"><br/>

</a> TrH Meter -
Measure hotness &amp; wetness with a cool display for only $25, who could turn
that down?</p>
<p>In a nutshell, it’s a way for someone with an idea or a prototype to feel out
the market before they order a bunch of parts. It’s kinda like a <a href="http://kickstarter.com" target="_blank"> Kickstarter
</a> , except tied to a specific deliverable item (as
opposed to a range of “rewards”) and it’s unambiguous about the fact that
you’re plunking money down to pre-order on something not just an idea or the
intent to deliver an item (if this sounds familiar I wrote about <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/this-is-how-products-of-the-
future-will-be-born/" target="_blank" title="This is how products of the future will be born"> a related
topic </a> a few
days ago).</p>

</a> Let me tell you, you can never have too many chainable,
intelligent stepper motors…</p>
<p>It’s all pretty geeky stuff right now, but it’s not hard to imagine more
consumer-oriented devices filling this space soon. I for one have several
ideas I’ve considered taking to market but I wasn’t sure if the cost to build
would match up with what the market would bear. Now I have a chance to find
out!</p>
