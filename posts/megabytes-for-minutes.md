<div class="content">
<p>I figured out a way to (dramatically) reduce the memory footprint of my new
app (a necessity, because after too much use it would crash due to out of
memory conditions).</p>
<p>I held off because it was a pretty major change to the app, but now that some
of the other more annoying issues are resolved, the time came to address this.</p>
<p>I’m happy to say that after only about 45 minutes of coding and debugging not
only has the change been made, but the results are spectacular. I need to do
some more extended testing, but so far it’s looking very good.</p>
<p>I also spent a little time working on the treehouse tonight, I think manual
labor helps debugging.</p>
