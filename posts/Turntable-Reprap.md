<p><em>Lately I’ve been a bit obsessed with building a second Reprap printer, and in
particular interested in unconventional designs. One design that is
particularilly interesting to me is the idea of a Reprap with a rotating build
platform (like a turntable), and in my research I ran across references to the
information below.</em></p>
<p><em>The page linked to now returns a 404, but I was able to dredge up the content
using The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. I have reprinted it here to
ensure that it remains avaliable, howerver if that is in violation of anyone’s
rights I’d be happy to cooperate with moving it elsewhere, my primary concern
is that this information doesn’t just dissapear into the vastness of the
Internet’s Write-Only memory…</em></p>
<p>Turntable Proposal</p>
<p>Hans Wargers</p>
<p>It can be made with only a drilling machine and other simple not expensive
tools.<br/>
It is driven by a computer in delphi but the dll can also be used by other
languages. It has x,y and z axes.<br/>
It is also possible to work with one motor but this one is much easier to
make.<br/>
You have a rotating surface something like a turntable.<br/>
Here on this rotating surface the model is printed. This surface is driven<br/>
by a electro motor<br/>
The print head moves a right angle on the direction of the moving surface.<br/>
These print head is driven by a threaded rod .<br/>
It is the same principle as a lathe on which the two movable components<br/>
(claw plate and support) are coupled by means of cog wheels and a threaded<br/>
rod to each other.<br/>
At each complete rotation of the rotating surface, the distance that the<br/>
print head on the threaded rod has taken is equal to the size of the<br/>
resolution of the print head</p>
<p>For example the resolution is 1 mm and the pitch of the threaded rod is 1<br/>
mm by each rotation(M6 or M7).<br/>
At each rotation of the surface then also the threaded rod must make a 1<br/>
revolution.<br/>
When printed by the print head there will be a track of ink drops (similar<br/>
to<br/>
the spiral of the pit in a .L.P.) and this track covers the total surface<br/>
without inter space<br/>
As the print head has reached the end of the threaded rod .<br/>
The electro motor stops and will start turning into the opposite direction.<br/>
the print head succeeds the old track but only from the opposite direction<br/>
and can therefore simply continue to print.<br/>
As the print head reaches the start point, the electro motor stops and will<br/>
start turning into the opposite direction again.<br/>
This is repeated till the piece of work is printed.<br/>
There are 2 sensors necessary: one to stipulate the beginning point of the<br/>
threaded rod and one to stipulate the rotation of the rotating turntable<br/>
each time. Everything can probably be made by means of rp except for the<br/>
electro motor and the two sensors.<br/>
Here some photo’s and a movie made with two electromotors and a construction
possible with one electromotor. However not interesting on this moment.</p>
