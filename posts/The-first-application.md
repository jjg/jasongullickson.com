<div class="content">
<p>I want to build an application that runs on top of JSFS because it’s hard to
describe just how powerful it is abstractly; but I struggled for a long time
deciding what to write first. Then the obvious answer finally struck me: an
editor. An editor (and more specifically, a “programmer”) would allow further
development to occur within JSFS itself, simultaneously serving as a
demonstration as well as an demanding application to drive the system forward.
I feel really dumb for not realizing this earlier, it’s kind of the go-to
starting point for every general-purpose operating system. - Jason</p>
