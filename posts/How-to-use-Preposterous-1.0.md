<div class="content">
<p>It occurred to me that the welcome email could use some better instructions on
using Preposterous, but I’ve promised myself to stay out of the code for at
least a week after the 1.0 release was posted.  So, until I can update the
welcome email, here’s some basic instructions, <em>in blog form!</em></p>
<p>_<br/>
_</p>
<p><strong>To create a new blog</strong></p>
<p>Send an email containing your first post (“hello world” is sufficient) to <a href="mailto:preposterous1984@gmail.com" target="_blank">
preposterous1984@gmail.com </a> .  You’ll get
an email back letting you know the blog was created and you’ll get a link to
the new blog as well.</p>
<p><strong>To add a new post</strong></p>
<p>Send another email to <a href="mailto:preposterous1984@gmail.com" target="_blank"> preposterous1984@gmail.com
</a> !  Preposterous currently supports text,
HTML, photos/images and most audio and video formats, so send anything  you
like to create a new post.  Once the new post has been… posted, you’ll get
an email back from Preposterous letting you know it’s ready with a link that
goes directly to the new post.</p>
<p><strong>To edit a post</strong></p>
<p>Send the updated post <em>using the exact same title</em> to <a href="mailto:preposterous1984@gmail.com" target="_blank">
preposterous1984@gmail.com </a> .
Preposterous will replace the old post with the new one, and send you an email
when the updated post is ready.</p>
<p><strong>To delete a post</strong></p>
<p>Deleting a post is like updating a post, except instead of sending an email
with updated information, you send one that is empty.  Currently, this doesn’t
remove the old post entirely (it will still be listed in the index), but it
will remove the contents of the post.  Removing the post from the index is on
the todo list…</p>
<p><strong>To see who else is using Preposterous</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://preposterousme.com" target="_blank"> http://preposterousme.com </a> to see a list
of everyone who’s posting to the beta site.</p>
<p>This should be enough to get you started.  If you think of something else you
should be able to do, take a look at what’s being worked on here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposterous/issues?state=open" target="_blank"> https://github.com/jjg/preposterous/issues?state=open
</a></p>
<p>If something you need isn’t on that list, post a new Issue and we’ll see what
we can do about it.  Also if something doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to,
you can use this Issues list to let us know about that too and we’ll work on
fixing it up in the next release.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this version of Preposterous, let me know when you find bugs
and I look forward to seeing what you do with it!</p>
