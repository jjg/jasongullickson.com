<div class="content">
<p>A novel use of <a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposterous" target="_blank"> Preposterous </a> came to
mind this morning.</p>
<p>Since all you need to do to create a Preposterous blog is <a href="http://preposterousme.com/oregon-king-uranus-autumn/how-to-use-
preposterous-1-0.html" target="_blank"> send an email
</a> , any system capable of sending email can create a
Preposterous blog.</p>
<p>A number of systems I’m responsible for are capable of sending notifications
and logging events via email.  These emails are sent to groups of individuals
which works OK, but it can flood the ol’ inbox, and it’s also not great if you
need to grant someone access to the event/log history who hasn’t already
received all the messages.</p>
<p>By adding <a href="mailto:preposterous1984@gmail.com" target="_blank"> preposterous1984@gmail.com </a> to
the destination for these emails, you get a nice little chronological record
of these messages and events that anyone can review.</p>
<p>Of course care must be taken not to send anything sensitive to these blogs (as
they are public), but that’s good advice for both humans and machines.  If
this application becomes popular I’d consider implementing measures to hide
these posts from the blog index but I don’t know that I’d ever add support for
truly private posts on <a href="http://preposterousme.com" target="_blank"> preposterousme.com </a> (for
that I’d recommend running your own server, which is a <a href="http://preposterousme.com/oregon-king-uranus-autumn/preposterous-on-the-
raspberry-pi.html" target="_blank"> pretty low hurdle
</a> itself).</p>
<p>If your machines create a Preposterous blog I’d love to hear about it!</p>
