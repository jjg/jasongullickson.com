<p>I’m excited to make the switch to postach.io.  My original plan was to wait
until their Wordpress migration tool was ready, but I might alter that course.</p>
<p>Evernote has become more central to my workflow, and while I don’t love having
non opens-source software in a critical role, it’s the best option at the
moment and they have a good API if I need to eject.</p>
