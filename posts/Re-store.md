<p>I’m re-considering a frame-up restoration.</p>

<p>On one hand I think doing so will definitely blow my deadline of getting the
bike rideable in time for the fall crud. On the other hand, maybe having it in
boxes in all over the garage will motivate me to make more time for the
project.</p>
<p>Six of one…</p>

I blame <a href="http://www.brillo.com/" target="_blank"> Brillo </a> , because I finally got around to
giving them a try on the bike’s chrome (one of the mufflers and the gas cap)
and I was shocked to see that it actually worked to remove the decades of rust
from the surface, leaving it as brilliant as a mirror. Seeing those funky
Jetsons-esque cans glimmer in the daylight made me re-think the whole “get it
done now and make it pretty later” attitude of this project so far.</p>
<p>Also the girls picked out some great colors for a new paint job and it would
just be easier to do a good job of that with the parts all…apart.</p>
<p>I’ll give it a week to decide.</p>
