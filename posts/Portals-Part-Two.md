<p><a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/windows-portals-and-a
-replacement-for-the-internet/" target="_blank"> Awhile back </a> I noodled on the idea of a device that was
simply a portal to the Internet and nothing more. Yesterday I was reading <a href="http://m.linuxjournal.com/content/swap-your-laptop-ipad-linode" target="_blank">
this post </a>
and that combined with my own reassessment of my portable computing needs
brought the idea to mind once again.</p>
<p>To some degree these devices exist. The <a href="http://litl.com/webbook/meet-webbook/overview.htm" target="_blank"> Litl Webbook
</a> (and later, the
Chromebook) function in this way however both have the trappings of their
personal computer ancestors and therefore disregard any innovation that could
be had by eschewing the old forms and re-engineering the device and experience
in light of this new way to interact with information via the device.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G" target="_blank"> Boot 2 Gecko </a> is a project closer to this
ideal, and while it’s currently feasible to do so, I believe that marring this
device to the Web is too limiting for my application (additionally B2G is
designed with the limitations of current devices in mind, which make sense for
its goals, but which make it non-ideal for for what I am describing).</p>
<p>In the early 90’s I was drawn to the work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier" target="_blank"> Jaron Lanier
</a> and other pioneers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality" target="_blank"> Virtual
Reality </a> (in fact that was what
I told the counselor I wanted to work on after high school, and they suggested
technical college…?). For a couple of years I worked on a personal computer
operating system centered around the Virtual Reality experience (Virtual
Reality Operating System or VROS, creative name I know…) but continually
bumped-up against the cost and limitations of interface hardware at the time.</p>
<p>The cost of head-mounted displays has been steadily dropping since the initial
excitement about them in the 1999’s and the quality has been improving well
(in fact I was very close to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-
game?ref=search" target="_blank"> backing a Kickstarter project
</a> for a very nice display and now I’m kicking myself for
missing it).</p>
<p>Non-physical interface devices are also becoming more viable, there has always
been experimental interface devices that use EEG or other biological signals
for input to computer software but recently there have even been <a href="http://www.emotiv.com/" target="_blank"> consumer-
grade devices </a> of this sort. Additionally, speech and
gesture recognition have improved to the point where they are good enough to
be used on a daily basis and are incorporated in many consumer devices.</p>
<p>Finally, starting with the iPhone, embedding an array of sensors (proximity,
acceleration, gyroscopic, etc.) has become commonplace in many devices and
developers are getting very creative with ways to leverage these inputs in
software applications. I think everyone was surprised at how quickly software
developers embraced these new forms of input and the impact it has had on user
interface design.</p>
<p>The availability of these interface technologies, combined with a market
interest in in the idea of a device that provides a transparent connection to
the Internet indicates to me that the time may be drawing near for a personal
computing experience akin to what I was working on in the early 90’s but was
beyond both the technology and psychology of the time. It may finally be the
right time to resume that work.</p>
