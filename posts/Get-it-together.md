<p>Since it may be awhile before I have the non-printed components for OffGRiD
took a run at modeling the basic dimensions of the parts and fitting them
together with the stuff I’ve designed so far.</p>

<p>Obviously there’s a <strong>lot</strong> more to do, but once I have placeholders for the
rest of the parts I should be able to run off some more accurate printable
parts.</p>
