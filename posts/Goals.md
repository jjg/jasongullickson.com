<p>I ran across this passage in the review of The Beastie Boy’s “Hot Sauce
Committee Pt. 2” on <a href="https://www.murfie.com/albums/beastie-boys-hot-
sauce-committee-part-two--2" target="_blank"> Murfie </a> :</p>
<p>”  All this hurly-burly camouflages the essential truth of  The Hot Sauce
Committee  : that  the Beasties  could sit on an album for two years to no ill
effect to their reputation or the record’s quality. This doesn’t suggest
they’re out of step so much as they’re out of time, existing in a world of
their own making, beholden to no other standard but their own.  “</p>
<p>That paragraph so precisely describes my personal vision of nirvana (not
Nirvana) that reading it gave me chills.</p>
