<p>Software developers who launch programs and then fail to support them are
sometimes referred to as “deadbeat dads”.  It makes me wonder, what is the
female equivalent of a deadbeat dad?</p>
<p>Don’t panic, I don’t plan to abandon <a href="https://github.com/jjg/preposterous" target="_blank"> Preposterous
</a> , but from all outward appearances it
might seem like I have.  Preposterous was born in a fit of fiery passion,
version 1.0 being released just days after the project began.</p>
<p>After taking a week off from the project (something I try to do with every
type of project) I sat down renewed and penned a somewhat (by comparison)
ambitious plan for a 2.0 release, a release that would make Preposterous have
the capabilities that are expected from a blogging platform but would retain
the elegance and simplicity of Preposterous 1.0.</p>
<p>Charging forth, these features fell to my keystrokes one after another and
within two weeks all but a handful had been committed to the repository.  With
only a few more remaining, I felt confident to let the scope creep a little
and work in a few things that I thought would be really cool.</p>
<p>Now mind you that I’ve been doing this long enough that I should have known
better, and I definitely should have known that, consciously or not, I had
pushed the hardest problems to the back of the line.  What I <em>should</em> have
done was stick to the original list and kill all the original bugs and
features before adding more, but you know, hindsight and all that.</p>
<p>Then came the new bugs.  Some came from the new code I was writing, some came
as the result of more extensive testing and use of 1.0, but in either case the
amount of work that needed to go into 2.0 started to mount, and this wasn’t
the fun kind of work like building new features, it was the not-fun kind of
work like trying to figure out why every email program on the planet did
different things with embedded/attached images, seemingly even between
versions of the same program!</p>
<p>This state of affairs was really wearing me down, so much so that I stopped
using Preposterous frequently because my own dog food was just making me too
sick.</p>
<p>What I did do <em>right</em> was continuously integrate the 2.0 features into the
mainline and release them into production unannounced.  So in reality by the
time I made the 2.0 release announcement, most of the new features would have
had plenty of production use and may have even been through a few debugging
cycles.</p>
<p>This is where Preposterous stands today.  A considerable subset of the
features slated for 2.0 are (and have been) available to production users
along with a few “bonus” features I slipped in along the way.  What is missing
are a couple of things a real blogging platform should have (like proper
deletion of posts) and a few very nasty bugs around handling attached/embedded
media.  Instead of letting this “almost 2.0” state get me down, I’m going to
embrace it, and begin working frequently with Preposterous even if I have to
limit that use to the “happy path” until I’m able to address some of these
shortcomings.</p>
<p>Along the way I hope to encounter others who see the beauty in the idea of an
email-only driven blog, and can feed off their encouragement and help bringing
Preposterous to a point where it’s valuable to a wider audience.</p>
