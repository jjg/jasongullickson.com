<div class="content">
<p>So the other night my daughter had the audacity to attempt to create a <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank">
YouTube </a> channel.</p>
<p>She went to <a href="http://youtube.com" target="_blank"> youtube.com </a> , signed in with her <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank"> Google
</a> email &amp; password and then was prompted to enter birth
date.  After supplying this and clicking “next”, she received a big red
message that said she was too young to have a Google+ account, and that her
account was now locked, which means no access to any Google services (gmail,
docs, etc.).</p>
<p>The message said, If she had specified her birthdate incorrectly she could use
one of the three links provided which could be used to unlock the account by
providing a credit card, a federal ID or something involving a fax machine.</p>
<p>The message went on to say that if this was not a mistake, that the account
and all data associated with it would be deleted in something like 19 days.</p>
<p>I understand that maybe there are now laws prohibiting children under a
certain age from having accounts on social networks or some such thing,
however she has been using these services for <em>years</em> and has hundreds of
documents stored in Google Docs.  Perhaps her age was requested back when her
original gmail account was setup, but then why was it requested again?
Regardless, at this moment years worth of her work was now locked away and
queued up for deletion, and the only way to unlock it is essentially to
falsify identity information.</p>
<p>After giving this some thought, I came to the conclusion that the only thing
to do was to attempt to recover the account, even if that meant lying to
Google about her age.  If nothing else, this appeared to be the only way to
have a chance to extract her work from their systems before it was destroyed.
So I went ahead and took the credit-card route, specified my birthdate and
provided the credit card information (all using my name, obviously not he same
name used for the Google account).</p>
<p>Surprisingly this just worked.</p>
<p>We could talk about the questionable nature of a system that would be so
concerned about your age as to threaten to delete your data, but is willing to
release its grip as soon as you can provide <em>someone</em> <em>else’s credit card</em> ,
but the more significant thing to me here has to do with Googles ability to
legally destroy the documents and information you have trusted them with.</p>
<p>I say legally because I assume that they have arranged their terms of service
in such a way that it grants them the legal right to do so, after all if not
then they would be breaking the law by deleting the data in your account.</p>
<p>This being the case, it made me think long and hard about who actually owns
the stuff you store in Googles systems.  While the legal definition may vary,
I would say that from a practical perspective, if someone can legally destroy
something you own, <em>then you don’t really own it</em> , and you should put some
thought into how many hours you’ve spent creating the content stored in your
Google Docs, or on your Google Drive, or in your Gmail archive, or your
YouTube videos, etc., etc.</p>
<p>This is why I can no longer in good conscious use Google systems to create,
store or distribute anything of value, knowing that at any moment it could
simply all go away, that my access could be revoked and that the work itself
could be wiped from existence.</p>
<p>I know that most of you reading this will disregard it, or choose to ignore
the warning (I probably would have too), but I I felt compelled to share it if
only to explain why I’ll no longer be investing time in these services.</p>
