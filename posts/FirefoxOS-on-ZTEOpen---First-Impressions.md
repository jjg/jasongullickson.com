<p>Last night the <a href="http://www.ztedevices.com/product/smart_phone/2bcf2d56-0c9a-4129-a25c-
acce58c8e502.html" target="_blank"> ZTEOpen
</a> handset I <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/ZTE-
Mobile-US?_trksid=p2047675.l2563" target="_blank"> ordered via Ebay </a> arrived (much faster than expected).</p>

<p>To be clear, I had pretty low expectations for this device in light of its
specs, cost and maturity of the operating system.  That said, my expectations
have been exceeded so far.</p>
<p>This weekend I’ll be spending some time experimenting with installing some of
the apps I’ve been working on via the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org
/en-us/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/" target="_blank"> simulator </a> and next week I’ll have more to
say about the device, writing code for it and living with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/" target="_blank"> FirefoxOS
</a> on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The other order of business is securing a carrier (can’t just swap it with my
Pre since Verizon doesn’t seem to support UMTS); that’s another process that
I’ll try to write-up to streamline the process for others.  In the meantime
I’ve come up with this:</p>
