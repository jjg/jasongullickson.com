<p>“Cloning” is a term used to describe the process of creating a product by
simply copying an existing Open-Source design without making any changes.
Typically this is done in a way that reduces the cost of the product through
less expensive manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>This is generally frowned on by the open-source community, and is considered
by some to be an abuse of the freedoms provided by open-source licensing.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about this stuff, but I lean toward it being more
important to increase access than it is to protect the profits of a specific
company.</p>
<p>There’s two sustainable ways to look at this:</p>
<p>1.  The first is that I think people who can afford to support the original
creators should do so, if nothing else it’s our way to reciprocate the
advantages we have.</p>
<p>2.  The second is that good open-source hardware maintains competitive
advantage through continual innovation, not hiding behind artificial
protection mechanisms.  I don’t know what Arduino these boards are based on,
but I doubt they are the latest tech from the Arduino team.  As long as
Arduino keeps innovating, there will be a market of makers who can afford the
new stuff to support them.</p>
<p>Profiting off legacy designs is an old-fashioned business model that was
required in the days of years-long tooling and decades long design periods.
Let’s move on, and in doing so empower those with fewer resources to become
part of the community so they can come up with the next generation of open
source tech.</p>
