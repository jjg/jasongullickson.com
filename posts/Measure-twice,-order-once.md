<p>Here’s a bit of advice to all the budding “ <a href="http://jasonscrudrundiary.blogspot.com/2007/05/price.html" target="_blank"> $1000.00 Motorcycle
</a> “ mechanics out
there: Anytime you order a part, make sure it will fit your bike by actually
measuring the mating parts and don’t go by what “should fit based on the
model”.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why, but I fell squarely into this trap myself.</p>
<p>I had to order a new set of tyres since the ones that came on the bike are of
unknown age but definitely old. So I go to <a href="http://www.madisonmotorsports.com/" target="_blank"> Madison Motorsports
</a> and we look up in the book what kind of
tyres are available for a 197x CL350. As it turns out they are hard to get so
I place an order and forget about the whole thing for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I get a call last week that the tyres are in, so I <a href="http://jasonscrudrundiary.blogspot.com/2008/09/better.html" target="_blank"> spend a few hours
</a> getting the
wheels free from the bike and bring them down to the shop the next day.</p>
<p>Later that same day I get a call from the shop because there is a problem with
the tyres I ordered. I ordered a set of 18” tyres as this is the size of the
stock wheels on the 197x CL350, however when the guys at the shop tried to
mount them they found out that my front wheel is not 18”, it’s 19”.</p>
<p>This brought into question weather or not I had a CL350 at all (apparently the
SL350 had a 19” wheel). I know it’s a CL350 because that’s what’s stamped on
the frame, but then it all becomes clear:</p>
<p>_When I was<a href="http://jasonscrudrundiary.blogspot.com/2008/08/sunshine-of-my-hate-
part-1.html" target="_blank"> stripping and re-painting the tank
</a> I found out that there was some bondo filling in a few dents, and
there are other signs that the bike has been down. My guess is that when the
bike went down the original 18” wheel got bent and was replaced with this 19”
wheel. Maybe the whole front end was replaced? _</p>
<p>Now let me say here that this is all my fault. Instead of going with “what the
book says” I should have measured the wheels (hell, just read the numbers off
the tyre) and this could have all been avoided. Based on this, the shop could
have justifiably charged me for this tyre as well as another that actually
fits, but they have been most understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>Fortunately they were able to source a 19” tyre from a nearby supplier and
it’s still possible that they will get it ready before they take off for the
races at the end of the week. This could have been a show-stopper for the fall
run, but it just goes to show the value of having a good relationship with a
professional shop.</p>
<p>My old man was right…</p>
