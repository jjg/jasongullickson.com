<div class="content">
<p>About a year ago, I began writing <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> (known
then as “Preposterous”) to precisely fill my personal needs for a blogging
platform.  Now I’d like to refine and polish it into it’s purest form, and
create a publishing system that is <strong>perfect for 1000 users</strong> .  I also want
to use it as a test-bed for theories I have on building better software.</p>
<p>The first steps of this plan are already underway. <a href="http://preposter.us/" target="_blank"> http://preposter.us
</a> is now operational, serving <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us
</a> blogs on independent servers. <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us
</a> is no longer dependent upon Google for accepting email,
and eventually will manage it’s own DNS as well, making its only dependency a
public Internet address.</p>
<p>As they say, “freedom isn’t free”, and with this independence comes the cost
of operating, monitoring and maintaining these systems.  However the real cost
of this plan lie in software development which, unlike servers and network
access does not tend to decrease in cost over time.</p>
<p>I intend to cover these costs by applying a variation of the <strong>1000 True
Fans</strong> ( <a href="http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/)" target="_blank"> http://kk.org/thetechnium/2008/03/1000-true-fans/)
</a> approach.  Instead of
setting out to make <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> grow exponentially,
I plan to intentionally limit its membership to no more than 1000 users.  This
serves two purposes:  The first is that it allows the operational cost to be
predictable and decreasing over time.  The second is that it allows the
software to preserve its narrow, specialized feature-set; effectively
selecting only users for whom it is the right fit.</p>
<p>This second purpose is key because it is this deliberate, conscious limiting
of product scope that allows not only the operational expense to decrease over
time but also the software development expense, traditionally the more
difficult of the two to predict.  By focusing on a narrow set of features and
selecting only users who desire just these features the software development
work can be focused on improving these features to the point of perfection.</p>
<p>Based on a year’s worth of observation of the <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us
</a> software in action, and my familiarity Internet
application development and operation, I have selected $10.00USD per user per
month as the initial subscription rate for <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us
</a> .  This provides a theoretical maximum revenue for the
second year of <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> operation and development
of $120,000.00USD; a modest amount in the current market.</p>
<p>After the second year, operational costs and projected development costs will
be reviewed and calculated and if the peak subscription count is reached, the
price per user will be reduced to reflect the reduction of costs.  As
operational and development costs are constrained, over time it’s possible
that the overall cost of the system could become near or effectively zero.</p>
<p><strong>To be crystal clear,</strong> <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> will continue
to be an open-source project, freely available to anyone who would like to
download the code and host their own server.  A subscription will only be
required to utilize the platform hosted at <a href="http://preposter.us/" target="_blank"> http://preposter.us
</a> .</p>
<p>In addition to this subscription model, I intend to use <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us
</a> to experiment with the idea of users-as-investors.
It’s all too common to see the time and effort users have invested in a
platform discarded by software companies when the time comes that they are
acquired by another company or otherwise sold or dismantled.  I propose that
using a piece of software, even if it is free, entitles you to some portion of
ownership.  For <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> , this ownership is
expressed in the ability for users to shape future product direction, and have
a significant ability to influence choices that will impact the future of the
platform such as sales, acquisitions, etc.</p>
<p>Simply put, paying users of <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> will have
the ability to vote on feature-level changes to the software and even on what
bugs or defects are repaired first.  Should there ever come a time when an
offer to acquire <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> is made, the body of
users will have a controlling stake in the product capable of blocking the
sale or alternatively purchasing <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a>
themselves.</p>
<p>The exact details of implementing these proposed models is under development,
and it is the intention that these will continue to be developed as part of
the development roadmap for the second year of <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us
</a> ’s operation.  As these are not the most common
approach to operating and developing a system there is work to do in
discovering the best way to carry them out, but to be clear the intent is to
design, develop and operate a system that is deliberately limited to an
audience size that allows it to be financially viable while constraining
software and product development scope sufficiently to generate the highest-
quality software imaginable with a predictable, decreasing software
development cost.</p>
<p>If successful, <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us </a> could pave the way for
new software development business models that produce quality software in a
sustainable fashion without exploitation.</p>
<p>For the moment, there is existing work to complete before <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank"> Preposter.us
</a> will be ready to accept paid subscriptions (this is
expected to begin during the first quarter of 2015).  In the meantime, <a href="http://preposter.us/" target="_blank">
http://preposter.us </a> will continue to operate free-of-
charge for curious or adventurous users.  As a reward for their efforts during
this primordial stage of the platform, users who create blogs on <a href="http://Preposter.us" target="_blank">
Preposter.us </a> during this time will be grandfathered in
to the first year subscription program at no cost, so long as they maintain a
posting rate of at least one post per month.</p>
<p>To get started, email your first post to: <a href="mailto:post@preposter.us" target="_blank"> post@preposter.us
</a></p>
<p>I look forward to testing these theories together,</p>
<p>- Jason</p>
