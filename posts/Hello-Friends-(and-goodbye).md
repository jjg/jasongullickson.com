<p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>This is a bit overdue.  I’ve been feeling this way for a long time but
couldn’t really put my finger on it until tonight.  I’ve caught myself
engaging in negative behavior more and more frequently, most often taking
place online but even occasionally in person, and I don’t like it.</p>
<p>I remember the joy of tech, of a time before every conversation about
programming had to turn into a language debate, when the only thing that
mattered about a tool was that you could build something cool with it.  Now it
seems like almost every conversation turns into some sort of competition or
confrontation, political or ideological debate and it sucks all the joy out of
the work.</p>
<p>There’s so much good work to be done, and a lot of it going on.  I think that
social networks and media are very powerful tools for good, but in the last
few years they seem to be more effective at propagating negative broadcast
messages, and like a flat ethernet network, these storms can drown out
important data.</p>
<p>To stretch this analogy into the absurd, I considered finding a way to
firewall or VLAN these networks to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, but it
quickly became obvious that this is a futile effort.  The topology doesn’t
make it easy, and the nature of the nodes in the network make it nearly
impossible.</p>
<p>So as usual the most direct approach is best, and I’m planning to bow-out of
these systems for the foreseable future.  Instead I plan to concentrate on the
mountains of work avaliable which clearly contributes to a brighter future,
and do what I can to avoid incuring drag.  There will always be negative
influences, but it’s become clear to me that none are as extremely lopsided
than the modern-day AOL’s we’ve constructed at the cost of the robust,
independent, syndicated media we had before the dawn of Myspace.</p>
<p>I’ll be posting updates on my progress here, which is likely to lead to
improvements in this site (eating your own dogfood usually has that effect).
If you’d like to stay in touch, perhaps you’d consider joining up (just send
your first post to <a href="mailto:preposterous1984@gmail.com" target="_blank"> preposterous1984@gmail.com
</a> ).  I’d love to hear what you have to
say, and I’ll have time to do more in-depth reading now that I’ll be off the
140 character feedbag.</p>
<p>- Jason</p>
