<p>This is turning out to be harder than I thought.</p>
<p>The “bad song stuck in your head” problem has reached titanic proportions, I
had “Fireworks” (what I know of the song, which isn’t much) on loop for almost
six hours today.</p>
<p>My only relief was the concert at Swan Park tonight, which was good but over
too quickly.</p>
<p>I have found myself feeling more musically creative than usual, coming up with
little beats and melodies in my head; but I haven’t had any time to put them
down so it is all transient.</p>
<p>I’m really looking forward to Sunday, I’m making a list of what I’m going to
listen to already.</p>
