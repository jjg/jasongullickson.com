<p>No real news, I was going to do a review of <em>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</em> ,
but I thought I’d let you figure it out for yourselves, in the meantime, I’d
tell you we’re working on some new stuff for the site, but you wouldn’t
beleive me, but we are (confused yet?).</p>
<p>In any event, I’ll be adding an annoucement page where you can tune in and see
what’s new, and what’s really “coming soon”, in the meantime, there’s always
the current poll to waste time with.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, buy.com ended up sending me the order and charging my credit card for
the experience I guess, oh well, at least I get to take a Monster out in
January, or something like that.</p>
