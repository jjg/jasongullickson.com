<p>So, I had written a long article about a quest I was on to build a new server
for another of my projects, www.fish-zine.com, and I began writing an article
for this site about that process, but it was boring and I dropped it. Suffice
to say, I bought an SE/30 off of eBay and thought it would be funny to run
that site off a web server with a 40 meg disk and 5 megs of RAM.</p>
<p>It turned out to be less funny and more frustrating.</p>
<p>However, it did work, and I had planned on putting up a link here so you can
check it out, however something interesting happened. In addition to
installing a web server on this box, I also built a mailserver. I spent about
three days troubleshooting the mailserver, fixing routing loops, etc, and
finally, night before last, I got it working…how cool.</p>
<p>So I come home last night and check on it, and the system is locked up. Big
deal, right? Just turn it off and back on again. No…it just comes up with a
screen full of garbage, and no startup noise. Damn.</p>
<p>I let the box sit overnight, and still nothing. It’s like it burned up or
something. The weird thing is that it has been on since I recieved it (like
three weeks), and it didn’t burn up untill everything was working…bitch.</p>
<p>So, instead of my cool webserver, I have a new poll for you, I’m sure you’ll
enjoy it.</p>
