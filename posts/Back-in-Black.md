<p>Oh boy, more new code!</p>
<p>We rebuilt our primary server this weekend, skylab, something sweet about a
fresh install of everything, hopefully we can keep the logs free of errors for
at least a week (and my man kob can get some access to Oracle 1.2 is out, now
with email support for you lazy bastards that don’t wanna come back to get
your answers, and the library has some updates, including title counts in the
browse menu and a new feature that lets members leave comments for titles
(mini-reviews, smart ass remarks, whatever).</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and then there’s alf on the projects page, if you use msearch, you’ll
dig it, if you don’t, you might still find it useful, just the result of me
abusing Visual Basic…</p>
<p>…and yeah, there’s a new poll for yall to not respond to…</p>
<p>later sk8er…</p>
