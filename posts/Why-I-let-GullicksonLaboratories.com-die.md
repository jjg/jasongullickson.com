title: "Why I let GullicksonLaboratories.com die"

<div class="content">
<p>Tomorrow the domain <a href="http://gullicksonlaboratories.com" target="_blank"> gullicksonlaboratories.com
</a> will expire, and the online home of my
projects and research since 2009 will go dark…for awhile.</p>
<p>I’m letting the domain expire as a way to motivate my work on distributed and
decentralized networking.  Name resolution, and the domain name registration
system is a prime example of the kind of artificial scarcity whose elimination
is at the heart of my most important projects.  By allowing <a href="http://gullicksonlaboratories.com" target="_blank">
gullicksonlaboratories.com </a> to expire, I’m
directly affected by my procrastination in finding and promoting alternatives,
which should provide the additional motivation necessary to get the job done.</p>
<p>In the meantime I’ll be slowly redirecting links that point to <a href="http://gullicksonlaboratories.com" target="_blank">
gullicksonlaboratories.com </a> to this blog,
and I’ll be resurrecting parts of the old site here that may be of interest to
others as I work on turning the lights back on again.</p>
