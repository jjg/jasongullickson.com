<p>If you’ve been here before you’re familiar with my struggles with the <a href="http://www.gullicksonlaboratories.com/?s=qu-bd" target="_blank"> QU-BD
filament extruder </a> .
Thankfully those days are over due to the arrival of the <a href="http://reprap.org/wiki/J_Head_Nozzle#Mk_V-BV" target="_blank"> J-Head Mk V-BV
</a> from <a href="https://www.hotends.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=88" target="_blank"> Hot-ends.com
</a> .</p>

<p>The first hot-end I used was the <a href="http://www.makergear.com/products/operators-pack" target="_blank"> Makergear unit
</a> that came with my <a href="http://www.makergear.com/products/3d-printers" target="_blank"> RepRap
Mendel Prusa kit </a> .  It worked
well enough, but I often managed to jam it, and looking back I think the
biggest cause of this was the distance between the heating element and the
nozzle.  This can result in the filament freezing before it’s able to be
pushed out the nozzle, and conversely this arrangement the heat source closer
to the “cold-end” of the extruder which can cause the filament to melt too
high up and in my case, ooze out over the top of the hot-end and encase
everything in a plastic tomb.</p>
<p><img alt="It's hard to see in this photo, but liquid plastic has backed-up and began

in this photo, but liquid plastic has backed-up and began to flow outside of
the extruder barrel, which is bad.</p>
<p>This is what led me to the QU-BD, thinking that instead of replacing the
Makergear hot-end for almost the same price I could get two complete extruders
(and they looked so pretty!).  As it turns out, you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>The design of the J-Head addresses these heating problems by placing the
heating element inside the nozzle itself, far away from the cold-end of the
extruder.  This design looked to me to address the problems I was encountering
so I put the QU-BD’s in the parts bin, ordered a J-Head and dug out my old
Makergear extruder.</p>
<p>The J-Head from Hotends.com arrives as a “kit”, but there’s really only three
pieces to assemble and the hardest part is crimping on the appropriate
connectors to the heating element (a resistor) and the thermistor.  The
resistor needs to be installed into a hole in the head and based on the
instructions on the RepRap Wiki I wrapped the resistor in aluminum foil to
ensure a tight fit (I didn’t have any of the muffler compound they suggested
on-hand).</p>
<p>Next the thermistor is mounted by simply taping it into the pre-drilled hole
with some Kapton tape and it was ready to mount to the cold end.</p>
<p>The J-Head using the same mount as my stock Makergear hot-end so installation
was easy and I had everything back on my RepRap in a few minutes.</p>
<p>After about an hour of updating firmware &amp; host software (lots of new code
since the last time my printer worked) I hit the extrude button and cheered.</p>

months for this moment…</p>
<p>I had planned to add a glass build platform as well but this all came together
so quickly I just had to try out a real print.  Here’s a couple of shots from
the tests I did, there’s still plenty of calibration to be done and
adjustments to be made but overall I’d say that the J-Head has out-performed
everything else I’ve worked with.</p>
